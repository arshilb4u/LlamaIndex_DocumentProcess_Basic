I thank you \\nfor your wholehearted support to \\nthis initiative.\\nToday’s India is young and \\nentrepreneurial, adopting digital \\nfinance at an unprecedented pace. The \\ndigital revolution has penetrated every \\ncorner of the nation through Jandhan \\nAccounts, digital payments, usage of \\nsmart phones and low cost data. The \\ngrowth opportunities presented by \\nfinancial services are remarkable and provide a strong directional support to \\nthe economy. \\nAs various financial services are governed \\nby different regulatory frameworks, \\nwe believe, an independent financial \\nservices entity will allow us to access \\nthe opportunities available in the \\nIndian market. \\nJio Financial Services Limited along \\nwith its subsidiaries will leverage the \\ntechnological capabilities of Reliance \\nand digitally deliver financial services, \\ndemocratising access to financial \\nservices offerings for Indian citizens. \\nJio\\xa0Financial Services aims to provide \\nsimple, affordable and innovative digital \\nfirst\\xa0solutions. \\nJio Financial Services Limited is \\npositioned uniquely to capture the growth \\nopportunities in financial services sector \\nand play a crucial role in transforming the \\nlandscape of digital finance in India. \\nFinancial Performance \\nSummary for the Year\\nThere was continued volatility in the \\nglobal markets amidst disruptions in \\ntrade flows and economic uncertainties. \\nDespite the headwinds, Reliance \\nwas able to deliver another year \\nof remarkable performance both \\non operating and financial fronts. \\nConsolidated EBITDA was at `1,53,920 \\ncrore which is a robust 24.4% growth as \\ncompared to last year. Consolidated net \\nprofit also grew at 11.3% to `73,670 crore.\\nThe impressive growth was well rounded \\nand supported by all our business \\nsegments. Consumer businesses \\ncontinued their growth trajectory with \\na\\xa0rapid expansion of retail store footprint \\nand strong subscriber acquisition \\nin\\xa0Jio. O2C business delivered a record \\nperformance amidst a challenging \\nbusiness environment. \\nA switch to cleaner energy \\nsources is key to our \\ndecarbonisation strategy. \\nWe are making significant \\nstrides in establishing a \\nworld class solar energy \\nvalue chain. We are also \\nprogressing on building a \\ngreen hydrogen ecosystem. \\nOur goal is to provide \\naffordable green hydrogen \\nas a viable alternative to \\ntraditional fuels.\\nOur goal is to become Net Carbon Zero \\nby 2035. Accordingly, the development \\nof giga factories at the Dhirubhai \\nAmbani Green Energy Giga Complex \\nat Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. \\nConsidering the collective potential \\nof our five giga factories, we are well \\non track for establishing a world class, \\nself-sufficient green energy ecosystem. \\nThe transition from traditional fossil \\nfuels to renewable energy sources \\nis going to be a crucial milestone in \\nour history. We, as a company, have \\na proven record of creating value \\nthrough transformational changes, be \\nit the digital revolution through Jio, \\ntransforming consumer experience \\nand the retail landscape in India or \\nthe integration of our refining and \\npetrochemicals businesses into the oil \\nto chemicals value chain.\\nCONSOLIDATED EBITDA \\nH1,53,920  CRORE\\nCONSOLIDATED NET PROFIT\\nH73,670  CRORE\\nDear and esteemed \\nfellow\\xa0shareholders,\\nWe, at Reliance, have a \\ndeep-rooted belief that \\nsustainability is an integral \\npart of enterprise growth. \\nThe tremendous stress that \\nmankind has exerted on \\nnatural resources, since the \\nadvent of the Industrial \\nRevolution, has brought \\nus to a stage where we \\nneed to collectively ramp \\nup our efforts to combat \\nclimate\\xa0change.

China growth is expected to \\nrebound to 5.2% in CY23 from 3% \\non reopening of the economy after \\nthree years and continued monetary \\npolicy support. India is expected to \\nremain amongst the fastest growing \\neconomies as per IMF.\\nIndian Economy\\nThe Indian economy remained \\nrelatively stable amidst the global \\nimbalances caused by the Russia- \\nUkraine conflict. The economy grew \\nat 7.2% in FY 2022-23, down from \\n9.1% in FY 2021-22, as per the National \\nStatistical Office data release. \\nThe spike in global commodity prices \\npushed up prices in India too, with \\nretail inflation peaking at 7.79% in April \\n2022, above the medium-term target \\nband of 2%-6% of the RBI. The RBI \\ntook stringent measures to combat \\nthe rising prices, hiking repo rate six \\ntimes in FY 2022-23, from 4% at the \\nbeginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at \\nthe close of the financial year. Private \\nconsumption, however, witnessed \\na strong surge fuelling a boost in \\nproduction across sectors. Domestic \\nsector services activity remained \\nresilient with average Services PMI \\nhigher at 57.5 in FY23 vs 52.2 in \\nFY22. Manufacturing too remained \\nrobust with average manufacturing \\nPMI higher at 55.8 in FY23 vs 54.1 in \\nFY22. Credit growth gained traction \\nwith year-on-year growth of 15% (as \\nof March ’23) while deposit growth \\nlagged with year-on-year growth of \\n9.6%, leading to a rise in incremental \\ncredit-deposit ratio.\\nIndia overtook Japan and Germany \\nto become the third largest \\nautomobile market in terms sales in \\nDecember 2022. India also emerged \\nas the second largest mobile phone \\nmanufacturer globally. India’s digital \\nadoption continues in an accelerated \\nway. UPI payments continued their \\nimpressive run in FY 2022-23, with \\ntransaction volumes almost doubling \\nfrom ~45 billion in FY 2021-22 to ~84 \\nbillion in FY 2022-23, while transaction \\nvalue also surged to ~139 lakh crore in FY 2022-23 from ~84 lakh crore in \\nFY 2021-22. The pan- India monthly \\nmobile data traffic stood at 14.4 \\nExabyte in 2022 with 3.2x growth \\nover last five years. Rapid digitisation \\nsupported by solid infrastructure is \\ndriving efficiency and productivity in \\nthe economy. India’s external sector \\ncontinued to gain strength as FY23 \\nmerchandise exports grew to $447 \\nbillion, growing at 6% Y-o-Y and \\nservices exports grew to $322 billion, \\ngrowing at 27% Y-o-Y.\\nGlobal supply chain improvements \\nand falling commodity prices coupled \\nwith softening domestic demand are \\nlikely to moderate inflation to 5.1% \\nin the current financial year. With \\na growing working age population, \\na large domestic market, boost to \\ninfrastructure development and \\nadvent of digitisation, India is well \\npositioned to be the fastest growing \\nlarge economy in the world. India GDP \\nis expected to grow at 6.5% in FY24.Performance Overview\\nReliance delivered strong annual \\nperformance amid macro headwinds \\ncaused by geo-political conflicts, \\ndisruptions in commodity trade \\nflows and economic downturn. \\nResilience of Reliance’s strategic and \\noperational capabilities reflected \\nin its ability to adapt to dynamic \\nbusiness environments and navigate \\nthrough complex business situations. \\nGrowth was supported by agile and \\nefficient operations by all business \\nteams with sound strategic planning \\nand implementation.\\nEarnings growth was led by rebound \\nin O2C business, backed by healthy \\ndomestic demand, strong fuel \\nmargins and high utilisation rates. \\nOil and gas segment performance \\nreflected volume growth in KG D6 \\ngas production, higher gas price \\nrealisations and margin improvements. \\nOperational efficiencies continued \\nwith 100% uptime.\\nFiscal prudence and proactive risk management formed the guide rails for \\nnavigating a challenging macro environment. Despite synchronised raising of \\npolicy\\xa0rates by Central Banks and volatility in commodity prices, we contained the \\nrise in finance\\xa0costs while ensuring the Balance Sheet has strength and liquidity to \\nsupport growth\\xa0initiatives.\\nGlobal Economy\\nGlobal economy grew 3.4% in CY22, \\nslowing from the post-COVID rebound \\nof 6.2% in CY21. Growth was in-line \\nwith pre-pandemic average (2015-\\n19) of 3.4% despite Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict and aggressive rate hikes by \\ncentral banks. Advanced economies \\n(AEs) saw above-trend growth of \\n2.7% in CY22, higher than the 2.1% \\naverage seen in the five years prior \\nto the pandemic. This was led by \\nstrong growth in both US and Euro \\narea which grew at 2.1% % and 3.5% \\nrespectively. Inflationary pressures \\nremained near multi-decade highs \\nin AEs, with US inflation averaging \\n8% Y-o-Y (highest since 1980s), while \\nEuro area inflation also averaged a multi-decade high of 8.4%. Developed \\nmarket central banks aggressively \\ntightened their monetary policy to \\naddress inflation, with US Federal \\nReserve raising rates by 450bps in \\nCY22, while European Central Bank \\nhiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging \\nMarket and Developing Economies \\n(EMDEs) grew 4% in CY22, below the \\npre-pandemic average of 4.4% due \\nto slowdown in Chinese economy \\namidst frequent lockdowns. China \\ngrowth eased to 3%, well below the \\npre-pandemic average of 6.7% on \\ncontinued zero-COVID policy and \\nhousing downturn. Crude oil prices \\nwere elevated during FY 2023, \\naveraging $93/bbl, remaining above \\n$100/bbl in first half of the fiscal \\nyear due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, but receding in the second half with \\nChinese demand slowing and release \\nof strategic petroleum reserves from \\nOECD countries.\\nGlobal growth is expected to slow in \\nCY23 to 2.8% as the lagged impact \\nof synchronised global monetary \\ntightening.

RIL successfully \\nmanaged its Balance Sheet risks \\nthrough the challenging environment \\nwhile ensuring sufficient liquidity for \\nbusiness operations.\\nExternal Environment\\nA persistent broadening of inflation \\npressures triggered a rapid and \\nsynchronised tightening of global \\nmonetary conditions, alongside strong \\nappreciation of the US dollar against \\nmost other currencies. \\nThe rising price pressures were \\nexpected to produce a squeeze on \\nreal incomes as well as undermine \\nmacroeconomic stability. This led \\nmost Central Banks around the world \\nto rapidly lift nominal policy rates \\nto much above the pre -pandemic \\nlevels, both in advanced and \\nemerging market economies. The \\nUS Federal Reserve raised policy \\nrates aggressively by 500 bps in past \\nfifteen months, the fastest hiking \\ncycle since 1980. In Europe, the war-\\nrelated intensification of inflationary \\npressures led European Central Bank \\nto finally exit its negative interest \\nrate regime and ultra-easy monetary \\npolicy after eight years and raise \\ninterest rates by 325 bps in past \\nnine months. The real activity and \\nfinancial markets responded to the \\nremoval of monetary accommodation \\nwith slowing momentum in housing \\nmarket, credit conditions, labour \\nmarkets and PMI surveys. \\nIn response to progressive rate hikes \\nby the Central Banks, the global \\nheadline inflation started declining in \\nthe second half of the year. However, \\nthe decline in inflation print reflects \\nthe sharp reversal in energy and food \\nprices and the core inflation continues to remain sticky. Consequently, to \\nanchor inflation expectations major \\ncentral banks have signalled the need \\nfor staying course on a restrictive \\nmonetary policy stance. \\nOn the other side, the accelerated \\npolicy normalisation has brought \\nforth vulnerabilities in the US regional \\nbanks. The risk of contagion across \\nthe broader financial sector is inducing \\nvolatility in the financial markets and \\ndriving market-implied policy path \\non downside. \\nRBI too raised rates by a cumulative \\n250 bps in the year, in-line with global \\nmonetary tightening as inflation \\nremained persistently above RBI’s 6% \\nupper-target band. As the forward \\noutlook on inflation moderated \\ntowards 5-5.5% in the second \\nhalf of the year, RBI guided for a \\nconditional pause keeping the policy \\nstance focused on withdrawal of \\naccommodation. A prolonged pause \\nfrom RBI is expected to progressively \\nalign headline inflation to its target \\nwhile also supporting growth. \\nOn the external front, a noticeable \\nimprovement in India’s current \\naccount deficit (CAD) on back of \\nmoderation in oil prices and structural \\nstrength in India’s services exports, \\nis expected to keep CAD benign and \\nbelow 2% of GDP. The outlook on \\ncapital inflows also looks promising as \\nemerging markets growth is expected \\nto outperform developed markets. As \\nthe lagged effect of cumulative hikes \\nsets-in, developed markets is expected \\nto witness slowdown. In contrast, India \\nis expected to emerge as the fastest \\ngrowing economy in FY 2023-24 \\nwith 6.5%, while global growth are \\nexpected only at 2.8%.

However, it has \\nhelped to slow down the loss of \\npay-TV subscribers, an issue which \\nhas affected the industry since the \\nimplementation of the New Tariff \\nOrder (NTO) in early 2019, followed 20-23%  \\nCAGRby the pandemic a year later.

At the \\nstart of the year, strong oil demand \\ngrowth was expected as the economy \\ncontinued its recovery from the global \\npandemic. However, Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict introduced huge geopolitical \\nuncertainties and caused energy \\nprices to soar.\\nGlobal oil demand in CY 2022 grew \\nover 2 million b/d from 2021 but \\nremained below pre-pandemic levels.\\nThe Brent crude oil price averaged \\n$96.2/bbl in FY 2022-23 and the WTI \\nspot price averaged $95/bbl. Oil prices \\nrose significantly in the first half of \\n2022 due to geopolitical tension but \\ndeclined in the second half of the year.INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\\nNatural gas witnessed record high \\nprices in 2022 due to steep decline \\nin Russian piped gas supply to \\nEurope, higher gas burn in the power \\nsector and strong storage injections. \\nEurope TTF spot prices averaged a \\nrecord high of $38/MMBtu in 2022 \\nwhile Henry Hub prices averaged \\n$6/MMBtu, their highest level \\nsince 2008. Asian spot LNG prices \\nalso averaged $32.96/MMBtu for \\nFY 2022-23 which is highest level \\non record.\\nRecord high gas prices led to \\nan unprecedented reduction in \\ngas demand in industry in 2022. \\nGas consumption declined by an \\nestimated 2% in Asia and 13% in \\nEurope (over 70 BCM). United States \\nexperienced growth of 5.4% in gas consumption largely due to colder \\nthan average temperatures during the \\nheating season.\\nLNG demand was dominated by a \\nsharp surge in gross LNG imports \\ninto Europe, which was balanced \\nby a steep decline in the rest of the \\nworld, particularly in Asia. LNG supply \\ngrowth was relatively modest in 2022 \\nat 5.5%, despite an unprecedented rise \\nin LNG demand in Europe following \\nthe gradual decline in Russian pipeline \\ngas deliveries throughout the year.\\nThe Govt. of India appointed Dr. Kirit \\nParikh Committee to review domestic \\nnatural gas pricing. The Committee \\nrecommended removal of price ceiling \\non gas produced from High Pressure \\nHigh Temperature (HPHT) fields from \\nJanuary 1, 2026.PERFORMANCE UPDATE  F\\nFY 2022-23 FY 2021-22 % change Y-o-Y\\nRevenue ( ` crore) 16,508 7,492 120.3%\\nEBITDA ( ` crore) 13,589 5,457 149.0%\\nEBITDA margin (%) 82.3% 72.8% 950 bpsRevenues and EBITDA were up \\n120.3% and 149.0% respectively. \\nThis was mainly due to higher price \\nrealisation along with increase in \\nthe gas production as compared to \\nFY 2021-22.VISION\\nTo be a major contributor to India’s Gas based \\neconomy supplying ~30% of India’s production.\\nMISSION\\nOur mission is to maximise stakeholders’ value by \\nfinding, producing and marketing hydrocarbons and \\nto provide sustainable growth while catering to the \\nneeds of customers, partners, employees and the \\nlocal communities in which we do business.

Global warming \\nis having a compounding effect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further \\nstraining already stretched fiscal balances. \\nFor businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as \\noutlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term \\nextreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition \\nrisks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system \\nwhich includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, \\nand changes in stakeholder attitudes.Risk and Governance\\nClimate Change and Energy TransitionStrategic and  \\nCommercial RisksSafety and \\nOperational RisksCompliance and  \\nControl RisksFinancial  \\nRisks\\nStrategic and Commercial RisksRISKS AND RESPONSE\\nPhysical Risk\\nThroughout the year, an array of \\nclimate change induced weather \\nevents was experienced around \\nthe globe and in India too. These \\ncalamities included extreme weather \\nevents like intense heatwaves, \\ncyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, \\nand others, affecting almost every \\nregion of the country and causing \\nunprecedented levels of destruction. \\nHaving a wide geographical spread, \\nthe organisation is susceptible to \\nsuch erratic weather phenomenon \\nwhich could cause disruptions in \\nits operations and supply chains, in \\naddition to causing negative impact \\non the wellbeing of our people and \\nour assets.Transition Risk\\nRisks Related to Policies, Law and \\nRegulations\\nDriven by ongoing geopolitical \\ntensions and the urgency to act on \\nclimate change, a new global energy \\norder is emerging - leading to a \\nshift in the way energy is produced \\nand consumed. This gradual move \\naway from fossil fuels is prompting \\nan increased focus on developing \\npolicies, incentives and regulatory \\nframeworks that can bolster the \\nadoption of low-carbon technologies \\nand green products - which may \\nimpact the demand for RIL ’s current \\nproducts. Additionally, the envisaged \\ndevelopment of a domestic carbon \\nmarket regime and thereby the likely \\nintroduction of stricter regulations \\nrelated to GHG emissions may impact \\nRIL ’s operating costs.Natural Capital Human Capital Manufactured Capital N\\nImpact on:   N, all businessesIntellectual Capital Social and Relationship Capital Financial CapitalH M\\nI S F\\nAdditionally, long term changes \\nin climate patterns causing rising \\ntemperatures and sea levels \\nmay also expose our operations \\nto future impacts of worsening \\nclimate change, which can impact \\nour business continuity in certain \\nvulnerable regions.\\nRisk Response\\nReliance has robust business \\ncontinuity management plans \\nto manage risks arising from the \\nphysical impacts of climate change \\nevents.

Risk and Governance\\nTreasury RisksFinancial Risks\\nImpact on:   F, all businesses\\nRisk Response\\nRIL maintained healthy liquidity \\nbuffer as it had raised Long term \\nSenior unsecured notes of $4.0 billion \\nin January 2022. Even as liquidity \\ntightened through the year, RIL \\nand its subsidiaries accessed Short \\nTerm markets comfortably and raise \\nshort term INR liabilities (including \\nCommercial Paper, Short-Term Loans \\nand Overdrafts against FDs) to fund \\nits working capital requirements. \\nReliance’s Retail business too \\nstrengthened the liquidity position by \\nraising Term Loans to fund its capex \\nand business requirements.Interest rate risk is managed actively \\nby maintaining an appropriate mix of \\nFixed and Floating rate liabilities which \\nlimits the translation of rise in market \\ninterest rates into higher coupon \\ncosts of market liabilities. RIL\\xa0has \\nraised significant amount of fixed rate \\nliabilities over the FY 2022-23 and \\n2H\\xa0FY 2021-22.\\nForeign Exchange (FX) risk arising \\nfrom the mismatch of foreign \\ncurrency assets, liabilities and \\nearnings is tracked and managed as \\nper the Internal Risk Management Framework. A significant portion of \\nthe payables and receivables of the \\nHydrocarbon business are in dollars \\nwhich minimises the cash flow risk \\non account of fluctuations in foreign \\nexchange rates.\\nDirect investments are restricted to \\nBoard approved select AAA rated \\ncorporates. Debt Mutual Fund \\ninvestments are managed and \\nmonitored based on a Internal Risk \\nManagement Framework.Risk Description\\nRIL faces following key financial risks which is actively managed by Treasury Team.\\nLiquidity Risk\\nIn FY 2022-23, inflation scaled higher in key economic regions of the globe on account of supply chain constraints. \\nThe onset of Russia Ukraine conflict drove commodity prices and inflation higher. Major central banks embarked on \\nliquidity tightening measures through the year as inflation spiralled. On the domestic front too, banking liquidity and \\nfinancial conditions tightened. Central banks are expected to calibrate their monetary stance based on the balance \\nof risks of continuing inflation and those of financial stability.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nReliance borrows funds from Domestic and International markets to meet its funding requirements. Faced with the \\nscenario of spiralling inflation, central banks across the globe raised policy rates through the year. US Fed raised \\nrates by 450 bps. RBI was also quick to respond to rising inflation in India and raised policy rates by 250 bps. The \\nrise in global and domestic rates translates into higher finance costs for RIL.\\nForeign Exchange (FX) Risk\\nRIL avails LT and ST Foreign currency liabilities to fund its capital investments and working capital requirements. \\nRupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. Given the steep rise in US interest \\nrates, the Dollar remained strong against most currencies through the year. The INR depreciated sharply through \\nfirst half of the year and closed the year with a depreciation of 8.4%.\\nCredit Risk on Investment Portfolio\\nReliance deploys its investible surplus in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds, \\nFixed Deposits and Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk.Looking Ahead\\nOur commitment to sustainable \\ndevelopment goes beyond \\nour operating boundaries. We \\ncontinuously aim to add value to our \\nstakeholders by improving lives.

This will help Reliance evaluate the cross-impact of \\nmaterial issues on the environment and society against its impact on the Company. Double materiality assessment will \\nallow the Company to recognise the impact of material issues holistically and enhance the transparency and breadth of \\nESG disclosures. \\nMaterial Issue and Associated Capital\\n  Reliance’s O2C operations have a greater environmental \\nimpact than its Retail and Telecom businesses. Abating emissions \\nfrom O2C is challenging due to the nature of its activities. Burning \\nfossil fuels during O2C operations releases greenhouse gases \\n(GHG), resulting in environmental impacts such as air and water \\npollution, habitat destruction, and the release of toxic chemicals.  Reliance faces several physical and transitional risks related to \\nclimate change. Physical risks include climate-related events that \\ncan impact the Company’s financial stability and value creation \\ncapabilities. Transitional risks stem from changes in the energy \\nmarket as the world progresses towards a more sustainable future \\nand embraces cleaner energy forms. Failure to adapt to these \\nchanges could lead to decreased profitability and stakeholder \\nvalue and regulatory penalties.Climate Change N\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  Reliance’s O2C business has significant environmental \\nimpacts related to GHG emissions, water use, waste generation, \\necosystems and biodiversity. In addition, the O2C business can \\nnegatively impact the health and wellbeing of stakeholders, \\nincluding workers, local communities, and consumers.  Effective environmental management is important for \\nReliance to comply with regulations, avoid legal risks, and \\nmaintain a positive reputation. It is, therefore, critical for the \\nCompany to assess potential risks associated with its operations \\nand mitigate them by reducing emissions, minimising water \\nuse, and preventing waste and pollution. Failure to do so \\ncould result in legal action, fines, and reputational damage. \\nPrioritising environmental sustainability demonstrates Reliance’s \\ncommitment to responsible corporate citizenship, protecting \\nbrand reputation and contributing to a more sustainable future.Managing Environmental Impacts N\\n  Reliance’s O2C business can have a negative impact \\non biodiversity through various activities such as habitat \\nfragmentation, deforestation, and erosion. This can result in \\nthe loss of habitats for wildlife, as well as cause a decline in the \\ndiversity and abundance of species.  Non-compliance with regulations related to land use, \\ngreenfield expansions, rehabilitation and redevelopment can \\nexpose the Company to regulatory and legal risks. Hence, it \\nbecomes imperative for Reliance to work with all stakeholders \\nand address ecosystem and biodiversity issues. Ecosystem and Biodiversity N\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  Reliance’s O2C operations generate high volumes of \\nhazardous waste that can negatively impact the environment and \\nhuman health. Reliance Retail and Jio also generate substantial \\nwaste from the use of paper, plastic, and packaging. Appropriate \\nwaste management practices are essential to minimise their \\nimpact on people and the planet. Reliance undertakes various \\ninitiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainability across its \\nbusiness segments, such as recycling PET bottles and used PPEs \\nand developing and deploying waste-to-road and waste-to-oil \\ntechnology solutions.  The Company generates various forms of waste from the \\nprocessing and storage of petroleum products. Many of these \\nsubstances are hazardous to human health and the environment \\nand may be subject to regulations. Reliance O2C unit reduces \\nand recycles hazardous waste streams and has effective and \\nprompt clean-up and remediation measures to ensure seamless \\noperations. The Company has a structured process to manage \\ndecommissioned facilities to reduce regulatory and litigation risks \\nand associated costs.Waste Management and Circular Economy N  The Company’s operations across business segments \\nimpact Goal 3, underlined in the UN SDGs, which aims to ensure \\nhealthy lives and promote wellbeing for all.\\nUN SDG: 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including \\nfinancial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare \\nservices and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable \\nessential medicines and vaccines for all.\\nUN SDG: 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths \\nand illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil \\npollution and contamination.  Workers involved in various manufacturing activities could \\nface significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working \\nenvironments and the hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition \\nto acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop \\nchronic health conditions. Therefore, worker health and safety \\nperformance can have an impact on Reliance’s operations and \\nprofitability. RIL recognises the importance of healthy and safe \\nworking conditions as a human right, implementing a globally \\nbenchmarked HSE framework across all sites, services, and officesHealth, Safety and Employee Wellbeing H\\n  Reliance has robust talent management systems to identify \\nhigh-potential employees and provide opportunities for career \\ngrowth and development. This helps to retain top talent, create \\na culture of continuous learning, and build a more skilled and \\nknowledgeable workforce that can drive business performance \\nand innovation. Effective talent management plays a crucial role \\nin improving both employee experience and client satisfaction, \\nwhich ultimately leads to higher business performance and \\nReturn on Investment for Reliance.  Reliance offers peer-benchmarked monetary and non-\\nmonetary benefits to enhance employee engagement and \\nimprove retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve \\nemployee engagement and work-life balance can positively \\ninfluence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.Talent Management H\\n  Maintaining cordial labour relations is crucial for Reliance \\nto ensure the wellbeing and productivity of its workforce. A \\nhealthy labour relationship means that both the management \\nand the employees are led by a common purpose, which \\nresults in improved job satisfaction, employee retention, and \\norganisational performance.  The Company’s significance to the economy as a major \\nemployer means that it is also often at the centre of public \\ndiscussions around labour practices. Therefore, poor performance \\nin labour relations can have serious reputational implications for \\nthe Company.\\nCustomers regularly interact directly with employees in the \\nRetail business. Reliance can face a decrease in market share and \\nrevenues from negative customer sentiments generated due to \\npublic disagreements between the Company and its workers.Labour Management H\\n  Vulnerable sections of the population, with limited \\ncapacity to defend their rights and interests, may need added \\neffort and support to ensure their human rights are protected. \\nThe\\xa0Company’s governance structures and actions can account \\nfor the same.

This encourages stakeholders to \\ncommunicate their concerns to the management and expect \\nprompt redressal.  Establishing effective grievance redressal mechanisms is \\nessential for Reliance to track the issues raised by stakeholders \\nand take immediate action to resolve their concerns.Grievance Redressal Mechanisms H\\n  Reliance places a high priority on regulatory compliance, \\nespecially in an evolving regulatory environment. The Reliance \\nCompliance Management System is a comprehensive, digitally \\nenabled framework regularly updated and integrated with \\nbusiness processes, risks, and controls. The Group Compliance \\nCommittee monitors regulatory changes and provides timely \\nupdates to Directors on key developments and judicial rulings.  Reliance gains a competitive advantage by staying \\ncompliant as it demonstrates a commitment to transparency and \\naccountability that is valued by customers, investors, and other \\nstakeholders. In addition, compliance also promotes workforce \\nengagement and retention, as employees feel proud to work for a \\ncompany that upholds high ethical standards.Regulatory Issues and Compliance G\\n  Reliance places utmost importance on employees and \\nensures a reduction in the likelihood and severity of potential \\nproject risks through early identification and a ready action plan to \\nhandle untoward incidents.  For Reliance, identifying and addressing probable risks \\nproactively is critical to improving the likelihood of achieving \\nbusiness objectives successfully.Risk Management R  Reliance is working on its Net Zero strategies led \\nby investments to set up the world’s largest integrated \\nmanufacturing ecosystem for green energy. By prioritising \\neconomic performance, Reliance can increase its profitability and \\ncompetitiveness and accelerate its progress on the Net Carbon \\nZero journey, benefiting its stakeholders, including shareholders, \\nemployees, customers, and suppliers.  Extreme climatic situations can derail Reliance’s business \\noperations across O2C, E&P, Retail and Telecom and impact \\nthe Company’s economic performance. Reliance is mindful of \\nthis and has set a goal to become a Net Carbon Zero company \\nand created new growth engines, like the New Energy business. \\nFuture-proofing the Company against the disruptions of climate \\nchange is critical to protect its ability to grow revenue and profits, \\nmanage expenses and allocate resources, and generate adequate \\ncash flows.Economic Performance F\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  The Company has helped boost the socioeconomic \\nwellbeing of several local communities through its operations \\nacross India. Raw material security can directly impact Reliance’s \\nability to generate employment for local communities. A lack \\nof raw material security may cause the Company to move \\nits operations to different locations leaving behind overused/\\nexploited spaces for local communities.  The availability of raw materials is crucial for the smooth \\nrunning of Reliance’s business operations. Judicious use of raw \\nmaterials can have long standing impact on the Company and \\nlocal economy. Raw material security provides investors and other \\nkey stakeholders confidence in the ability of the Company to \\nrun operations seamlessly. The availability of raw materials can \\nalso directly impact Reliance’s ability to meet market demand for \\nits products.Raw Material Security M\\n  The Company’s R&D team has a strong focus on developing \\nsustainable solutions and alternatives to preserve the natural \\nenvironment. Reliance’s streamlined processes and efficiency \\nenhancements have significantly improved the quality of life for \\nmany. Reliance innovations have led to higher productivity, better \\nresults and increased motivation among people to do better.  Reliance’s ability to adapt to changing trends and technology \\nhas made the Company one of the most successful businesses \\nin the country. Reliance’s R&D operation is a crucial growth \\nengine for the Company. Evolving market trends drive Reliance to \\ndevelop innovative solutions and streamline existing mechanisms \\nconstantly. Innovation also accelerates organisational growth and \\nstrengthens the Company’s industry leadership.Innovation and Technology I  Strong supply chain standards, monitoring mechanisms and \\nongoing engagement models with suppliers to address labour \\nconcerns are critical for Reliance to protect shareholder value over \\nthe long term. Sustainable supply chains are essential to further \\nthe Company’s progress on its Net Carbon Zero goal.  Reliance Retail relies heavily on third-party manufacturing \\npartners. Any failure on the part of suppliers to comply with \\ndynamically changing regulations and issues of human rights \\nviolations can disrupt the Company’s operations and create \\nnegative sentiments amongst stakeholders, including customers \\nand impact business. The Company has a structured approach \\nto enhancing supplier performance, deepening sustainability \\npractices, and a well-defined Code of Conduct that mandates \\nrespect for human rights across the value chain.Sustainable Supply Chain Management S\\n  Data privacy is a global concern that has increased \\nsignificantly in the past few years. Access to private data and lack \\nof digital privacy threatens the security and safety of millions of \\npeople worldwide. Reliance’s digital business is susceptible to \\ndata breaches, and the Company has implemented cutting-edge \\nsecurity measures and complies with all applicable regulations to \\nprotect its customers’ privacy.  Data breaches can result in the leakage of confidential \\ncompany information. Reliance’s extensive digital presence \\nand large market share makes it a common target for such \\nbreaches. The Company has implemented several initiatives to \\nmake its technology framework secure and resilient and protect \\nconfidential assets and information.Data Privacy and Cybersecurity I  Reliance has a well-established Code of Conduct that \\nis applicable to its employees and the value chain, supported \\nby strong governance structures and business practices to \\nprevent corruption and wilful or unintentional participation in \\nillegal or unethical payments or gifts to government officials or \\nprivate persons.  Managing business ethics and maintaining appropriate \\nlevels of transparency in payments to governments or individuals \\nare significant issues for Reliance. Strong relations are critical to \\nensure the Company’s ability to conduct business. Inappropriate \\naction or violation of business ethics could lead to significant \\none-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs. Reliance \\nensures compliance with all regulations and has a well-established \\nCode of Conduct that mandates ethical business behaviour \\nat all times. These measures offer adequate risk mitigation \\nopportunities and prevent adverse outcomes.Business Ethics, Integrity and Transparency H\\n→ PAGE 195\\n→ PAGE 195\\n→ PAGE 200\\n→ PAGE 208\\n→ PAGE 203→ PAGE 222\\n→ PAGE 42\\n→ PAGE 228\\n→ PAGE 130,  158\\n168 169\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nINTEGRATED APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Ambani\\nChairman and Managing Director, Reliance IndustriesThe tenets of Institutional Leadership \\nCapacity Building\\nAt the 45th Reliance AGM held on August 29, 2022, the \\nChairman, outlined the Company’s ten tenets for building \\nleadership capital through nurturing the Founder Mindset \\nat Reliance – now and in the future.\\nAmong the ten capitals outlined, the following eight are designed to strengthen the Company’s Human Capital.\\nPeople \\nCapitalReliance has an ongoing focus on human capital development by investing in and nurturing the skills, \\nknowledge, and abilities of the workforce. Mentoring is facilitated for employees to gain valuable insights \\ninto the Company culture and best practices, enhance productivity and grow professionally. \\nCapability \\nCapitalPromoting Capability Capital entails investing in and nurturing the skills, knowledge, and abilities of \\nemployees to expand their capabilities and improve their performance. Reliance ensures this through \\ncareer acceleration programmes designed to help employees advance their careers through training and \\ndevelopment opportunities, mentoring, and coaching.\\nTalent review and succession planning helps identify employees most likely to be successful in leadership \\nroles and other key positions. \\nAchievement \\nCapitalTo build a positive culture of recognition and motivation within the Company, Reliance rewards and \\nhonours achievers who exceed expectations. This reward might be in the form of financial incentives, \\npromotions, plaques or public recognition. \\nRelationship \\nCapitalTo strengthen relationship capital within the organisation, Reliance fosters a positive and inclusive \\norganisational culture through regular team-building activities, open and transparent communication, \\nand opportunities for employees to connect outside of work. Regular meetings, clear and concise \\ncommunication channels, and opportunities for employees to work together on projects and initiatives to \\npromote effective communication and collaboration. \\nTrust Capital Trust is a critical component of functioning at Reliance since it allows people to work together effectively, \\nmake decisions quickly and confidently, and build long-term relationships. At Reliance, leaders and \\nmanagers are encouraged to promote transparency and build regular communication with employees at all \\nlevels to create and maintain a sense of trust. \\nCooperation \\nCapitalReliance believes that cooperation is essential to achieving goals and objectives, as it allows people \\nto work together effectively and maximise their collective expertise and resources. The Company has \\nincluded cooperation as an integral part of its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and promotes cross-\\nfunctional collaboration. \\nReliance has created channels for open and regular communication and feedback to help employees work \\ntogether effectively and solve problems quickly and efficiently. \\nEmpathy \\nCapitalReliance believes compassionate capitalism needs compassionate leaders. Empathy capital at Reliance \\nis symbolic of the organisation’s compassionate leadership. Empathy is important for Reliance because it \\nallows people at the Company to connect with one another on a deeper level, understand and respect one \\nanother’s perspectives and experiences, and work together more effectively. \\nReliance also highlights empathy capital by encouraging employees to give back to the community and be \\nsocially responsible.\\nIntegrity \\nCapitalReliance upholds the highest standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. Ethics is one of the five \\nenablers of the Company’s strategy and, is a source of our competitive strength. Reliance is committed \\nto establishing a culture of integrity, transparency, openness and compliance – as evident in our Values, \\nBehaviours, and Code of Conduct. \\nReliance considers itself an integral part of the business ecosystem and takes it upon itself to extend \\nall support to our business partners to also work towards ethical conduct of business. Towards this, an \\ne-learning module – \"Satarkata\" – has been rolled out, and access is provided to identified business \\nassociates. This will help vendors better understand Reliance’s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) \\nand create the right levels of awareness about the Company’s expectations of ethical conduct from \\nbusiness partners.  Labour Management \\nand Human Rights\\nReliance follows the principles of \\nthe United Nations Global Compact \\non human rights, labour practices, \\nenvironmental protection, and \\nanti-corruption. The Company’s \\noperations adhere to local and \\nnational regulations and also ensure \\nadherence to the Code of Conduct. \\nCollective bargaining agreements cover \\nthe majority of permanent workers \\nacross all manufacturing facilities. No \\ninstances of child labour, forced labour, \\ninvoluntary labour, sexual harassment, \\nor discriminatory employment were \\nreported during the reporting period. \\nMen and women in the same roles \\nreceive equal pay at the entry-level \\nin Reliance.\\n  Business Ethics, \\nIntegrity and \\nTransparency\\nReliance’s Code of Conduct defines \\nthe behaviour expected from all the \\nemployees and stakeholders and \\nlays down the policies and systems \\nfor effective implementation. These \\nguidance documents enable employees \\nto operate with ethics, integrity and \\ntransparency at all times. The HR \\nLeadership periodically evaluates \\nthe people policies to keep them \\nrelevant to changing regulatory and \\nmarket requirements. \\nAn Ethics and Compliance Task Force \\n(ECTF) is in place to oversee and \\nmonitor the implementation of ethical \\nbusiness practices within Reliance. All \\ncomplaints related to ethics, non-\\ncompliance and violations of the \\nCompany’s Code of Conduct received \\nby ECTF are reviewed and reported to \\nthe Audit Committee every quarter. \\nReliance has proactively taken measures \\nto combat bribery and corruption. The \\nCompany has established a robust \\nAnti-Bribery Management System \\n(ABMS) as an additional pillar to support \\nexisting governance mechanisms. \\nABMS is a systematic framework of policy and processes set up by Reliance \\nto help prevent, detect and respond to \\nbribery risks. \\nThe Company has mandatory e-learning \\ncourses to help employees understand \\nthe norms required to work in a safe, \\ncompliant and ethical manner through \\nthe ABMS system. The learning \\nmodule sensitises employees about \\nthe concept of bribery, how it happens, \\nand its various types, causes, and \\neffects. The module helps recognise \\nred flags indicating bribery, advises \\nabout overcoming bribery, and explains \\nthe link between ABMS and Reliance’s \\nCode of Conduct. The module also \\nemphasises the importance of ABMS \\nviolation reporting. It highlights \\nReliance’s expectations from employees \\nand business associates in the context \\nof its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption \\n(ABAC) policy.\\nTo benchmark itself against the best \\nin class, Reliance has adopted the ISO \\n37001:2016 standards for its ABMS.\\n  Grievance Redressal \\nMechanisms\\nEmployees and other stakeholders are \\nrequired to report actual or suspected \\nviolations of applicable laws and \\nregulations and the Code of Conduct. \\nReliance has established a robust \\nmechanism through a Vigil Mechanism \\nand Whistle-blower Policy for reporting \\nand handling of such violations, termed \\nas ‘Reportable Matters’. Under this \\npolicy, the employees are encouraged \\nto report any such violations without \\nfear of retaliation.

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Company because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally \\nreliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant \\ntransaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and \\nraw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction \\nvolumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity \\nof the Company’s systems and data, cyber security has \\nbecome more significant. Automated accounting procedures \\nand IT environment controls, which include IT governance, \\nIT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations, IT application \\ncontrols and interfaces between IT applications, are required \\nto be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate \\nfinancial reporting.Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:\\n• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \\nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \\ninternal audit at the Company and identified IT applications \\nthat are relevant to our audit.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\n• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at \\nthe Company in respect of the overall security architecture and \\nany key threats addressed by the Company in the current year.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \\nfinancial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \\nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nInformation Other than the Financial \\nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\n• The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information. The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the Annual Report, but does \\nnot include the Consolidated Financial Statements, \\nStandalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s \\nreport thereon.\\n• Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements \\ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n• In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements, our responsibility is to read the other \\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the \\nother information is materially inconsistent with the \\nStandalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge \\nobtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \\nappears to be materially misstated.\\n• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have \\nnothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management and \\nThose Charged with Governance for the \\nStandalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the financial position, \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \\nincome, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in India. This responsibility \\nalso includes maintenance of adequate accounting \\nrecords in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing \\nand detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection \\nand application of appropriate accounting policies; \\nmaking judgments and estimates that are reasonable and \\nprudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of \\nadequate internal financial controls, that were operating \\neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness \\nof the accounting records, relevant to the preparation \\nand presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view and are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, \\nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Company’s \\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as \\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using \\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless the Board \\nof Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to \\ncease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \\nThe Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for \\noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of \\nthe Standalone Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the \\nbasis of these Standalone Financial Statements. \\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section \\n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing \\nour opinion on whether the Company has adequate \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements in place and the operating \\neffectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by the management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \\nmay cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern. If we conclude that \\na material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \\nattention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such \\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our \\nconclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained \\nup to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease \\nto continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, including the \\ndisclosures, an d whether the Standalone Financial \\nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieve s fair presentation.\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \\nStandalone Financial Statements that, individually or \\nin aggregate, makes it probable that the economic \\ndecisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the \\nStandalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative \\nfactors (i) in planning the scope of our audit work and in \\nevaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the \\neffect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements of the current year and are therefore the key \\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \\nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated \\nin our report because the adverse co nsequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\nOther Matter\\nThe Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for \\nthe year ended 31st March, 2022, prepared in accordance \\nwith Ind AS have been audited by the predecessor auditors. \\nThe report of the predecessor auditors dated 6th May, 2022, \\nexpressed an unmodified opinion.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \\nRequirements\\n1.

The right-\\nof-use assets is depreciated/ amortised using the \\nstraight-line method from the commencement \\ndate over the shorter of lease term or useful life \\nof right-of-use asset.\\n   The Company measures the lease liability at \\nthe present value of the lease payments that \\nare not paid at the commencement date of \\nthe lease. The lease payments are discounted \\nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease, if \\nthat rate can be readily determined. If that rate \\ncannot be readily determined, the Company uses \\nincremental borrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the \\nCompany recognises the lease payments as an \\noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term. (d) Intangible Assets\\n   Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition \\nnet of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \\nrebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion \\nand impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the asset to \\nits working condition for the intended use, \\nnet charges on foreign exchange contracts \\nand adjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the Intangible Assets.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an \\nIntangible Asset are measured as the difference \\nbetween the net disposal proceeds and the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss when the \\nasset is derecognised. The Company’s intangible \\nassets comprises assets with finite useful life \\nwhich are amortised on a straight-line basis over \\nthe period of their expected useful life.\\n   A summary of amortisation/depletion policies \\napplied to the Company’s Intangible Assets to \\nthe extent of depreciable amount is as follows:\\nParticular Amortisation / Depletion\\nT echnical \\nKnow-HowOver the useful life of the underlying \\nassets ranging from 5 years to 35 years.\\nComputer \\nSoftwareOver a period of 5 years.\\nDevelopment \\nRightsW.r.t.

Cost of inventories comprises of cost of \\npurchase, cost of conversion and other costs \\nincluding manufacturing overheads net of \\nrecoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to \\ntheir respective present location and condition.\\n   Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw \\nmaterials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are \\ndetermined on weighted average basis.\\n (i)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets \\n- Property, Plant and Equipment and \\nIntangible Assets\\n   The Company assesses at each reporting \\ndate as to whether there is any indication \\nthat any Property, Plant and Equipment and \\nIntangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash \\nGenerating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any \\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount \\nof an asset or CGU is estimated to determine \\nthe extent of impairment, if any. When it is not \\npossible to estimate the recoverable amount of \\nan individual asset, the Company estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the CGU to which the \\nasset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss to the extent, \\nasset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable \\namount. The recoverable amount is higher of an \\nasset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in \\nuse. Value in use is based on the estimated future \\ncash flows, discounted to their present value \\nusing pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \\nmarket assessments of the time value of money \\nand risk specific to the assets.\\n   The impairment loss recognised in prior \\naccounting period is reversed if there has been a \\nchange in the estimate of recoverable amount.\\n (j) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Company \\nhas a present obligation (legal or constructive) \\nas a result of a past event, it is probable that \\nan outflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation \\nand a reliable estimate can be made of the \\namount of the obligation. If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Company records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding of \\ndiscount is recognised in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n (k) Contingent Liabilities\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of \\none or more uncertain future events not wholly \\nwithin the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that arises from past events where it is \\neither not probable that an outflow of resources \\nembodying economic benefits will be required \\nto settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot \\nbe made.\\n (l) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term \\nemployee benefits expected to be paid in \\nexchange for the services rendered by employees \\nare recognised as an expense during the period \\nwhen the employees render the services.\\n  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Company recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related service. \\nIf the contribution payable to the scheme for \\nservice received before the balance sheet date \\nexceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit \\npayable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. \\nIf the contribution already paid exceeds the \\ncontribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date, then excess is recognised \\nas an asset to the extent that the pre-payment \\nwill lead to a reduction in future payment or a \\ncash refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Company pays gratuity to the employees \\nwho have completed five years of service \\nwith the Company at the time of resignation/\\nsuperannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days \\nbasic salary for every completed year of service \\nas per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The \\ngratuity liability amount is contributed to the \\napproved gratuity fund formed exclusively for \\ngratuity payment to the employees.

At the \\nend of each reporting period, the Company \\nrevises its estimate of the number of equity \\ninstruments expected to vest. The impact of \\nthe revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such \\nthat the cumulative expenses reflects the revised \\nestimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nShare Based Payments Reserve.\\n   The dilutive effect of outstanding options is \\nreflected as additional share dilution in the \\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share.\\n   In case of Group equity-settled share-based \\npayment transactions, where the Company \\ngrants stock options to the employees of its \\nsubsidiaries, the transactions are accounted by \\nincreasing the cost of investment in subsidiary \\nwith a corresponding credit in the equity.\\n (o)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded \\nat the exchange rate prevailing on the date \\nof transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated \\nat the functional currency closing rates of \\nexchange at the reporting date.

Additionally, \\nexchange gains or losses on foreign currency \\nborrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which \\nare related to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost \\nof such assets.\\n   Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are \\nrecorded using the exchange rates at the date of \\nthe transaction. Non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value in a foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rates at the date when the \\nfair value was measured. The gain or loss arising \\non translation of non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value is treated in line with the recognition \\nof the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items \\nwhose fair value gain or loss is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income or Statement \\nof Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income or Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where a \\nnon-monetary advance is paid/received, the date \\nof transaction is the date on which the advance \\nwas initially recognised. If there were multiple \\npayments or receipts in advance, multiple dates \\nof transactions are determined for each payment \\nor receipt of advance consideration.\\n (p) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or \\nservices are transferred to the customer at an \\namount that reflects the consideration entitled \\nin exchange for those goods or services. The \\nCompany is generally the principal as it typically \\ncontrols the goods or services before transferring \\nthem to the customer.\\n   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment \\nof goods to the customer or when the goods \\nis made available to the customer, provided \\ntransfer of title to the customer occurs and the \\nCompany has not retained any significant risks of \\nownership or future obligations with respect to \\nthe goods shipped.\\n   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised \\nover time by measuring the progress towards \\ncomplete satisfaction of performance obligations \\nat the reporting period.\\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of \\nconsideration which the Company expects to be \\nentitled to in exchange for transferring distinct \\ngoods or services to a customer as specified in \\nthe contract, excluding amounts collected on \\nbehalf of third parties (for example taxes and \\nduties collected on behalf of the government). \\nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction \\nof performance obligations and a receivable \\nis recognised when it becomes unconditional. \\nGenerally, the credit period varies between 0-60 \\ndays from the shipment or delivery of goods \\nor services as the case may be. The Company \\nprovides volume rebates to certain customers \\nonce the quantity of products purchased during \\nthe period exceeds a threshold specified and \\nalso accrues discounts to certain customers \\nbased on customary business practices which \\nis derived on the basis of crude price volatility \\nand various market demand – supply situations. \\nConsideration are determined based on its most \\nlikely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum \\nproducts contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on \\nprovisional price.\\n   Difference between final settlement price and \\nprovisional price is recognised subsequently. The \\nCompany does not adjust short-term advances \\nreceived from the customer for the effects of \\nsignificant financing component if it is expected \\nat the contract inception that the promised good \\nor service will be transferred to the customer \\nwithin a period of one year.\\n  Contract Balances\\n  Trade Receivables\\n   A receivable represents the Company’s right to \\nan amount of consideration that is unconditional.\\n  Contract Liabilities\\n   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer \\ngoods or services to a customer for which \\nthe Company has received consideration or \\nis due from the customer. If a customer pays \\nconsideration before the Company transfers \\ngoods or services to the customer, a contract \\nliability is recognised when the payment is made \\nor the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\\n   Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue \\nwhen the Company performs under the contract.\\n  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a Financial Assets is \\nrecognised using effective interest rate method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the \\nCompany’s right to receive the amount has \\nbeen established.\\n (q) Financial Instruments\\n  i.  Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nFinancial Assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the \\nfair value on initial recognition. Purchase \\nand sale of Financial Assets are recognised \\nusing trade date accounting. However, trade \\nreceivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at \\ntransaction price.  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n   a)  Financial Assets measured at \\nAmortised Cost (AC)\\n     A Financial Asset is measured at \\nAmortised Cost if it is held within a \\nbusiness model whose objective is \\nto hold the asset in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the \\ncontractual terms of the Financial Asset \\ngive rise to cash flows on specified \\ndates that represent solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n   b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair \\nValue Through Other Comprehensive \\nIncome (FVTOCI)\\n     A Financial Asset is measured at \\nFVTOCI if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by \\nboth collecting contractual cash flows \\nand selling Financial Assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the Financial Asset \\ngive rise on specified dates to cash \\nflows that represents solely payments \\nof principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n   c)  Financial Assets measured at \\nFair Value Through Profit or Loss \\n(FVTPL)\\n     A Financial Asset which is not classified \\nin any of the above categories are \\nmeasured at FVTPL. Financial assets \\nare reclassified subsequent to their \\nrecognition, if the Company changes \\nits business model for managing \\nthose financial assets. Changes in \\nbusiness model are made and applied \\nprospectively from the reclassification \\ndate following the changes in business \\nmodel in accordance with principles \\nlaid down under Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments.\\n  C.  Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and \\nJoint Ventures\\n    The Company has accounted for its \\ninvestments in Subsidiaries, associates and \\njoint venture at cost less impairment loss (if \\nany). The investments in preference shares \\nwith the right of surplus assets which are \\nin nature of equity in accordance with Ind \\nAS 32 are treated as separate category of \\ninvestment and measured at FVTOCI.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n332 333\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss, except \\nfor those equity investments for which \\nthe Company has elected to present the \\nvalue changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’. However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments are recognised in Statement of \\nProfit and loss when the\\xa0Company’s right to \\nreceive payment is established.\\n  E. Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the \\nCompany uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ \\n(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \\nFinancial Assets other than those measured \\nat Fair Value Through Profit and Loss \\n(FVTPL).\\n    Expected Credit Losses are measured \\nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \\nequal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For Trade Receivables the Company \\napplies ‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables.\\n    The Company uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Company uses 12 \\nmonth ECL to provide for impairment loss \\nwhere there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in \\ncredit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Liabilities are recognised at \\nfair value and in case of borrowings, net of \\ndirectly attributable cost. Fees of recurring \\nnature are directly recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within \\none year from the balance sheet date, the \\ncarrying amounts approximate fair value due \\nto the short maturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Company uses various derivative \\nfinancial instruments such as interest \\nrate swaps, currency swaps, forwards \\n& options and commodity contracts to \\nmitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, \\nexchange rates and commodity prices. \\nAt the inception of a hedge relationship, \\nthe Company formally designates and \\ndocuments the hedge relationship to \\nwhich the Company wishes to apply hedge \\naccounting and the risk management \\nobjective and strategy for undertaking the \\nhedge. Such derivative financial instruments \\nare initially recognised at fair value on \\nthe date on which a derivative contract \\nis entered into and are also subsequently \\nmeasured at fair value.\\n    Derivatives are carried as Financial Assets \\nwhen the fair value is positive and as \\nFinancial Liabilities when the fair value is \\nnegative. Any gains or losses arising from \\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives are \\ntaken directly to Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, except for the effective portion of \\ncash flow hedge which is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income and later \\nto Statement of Profit and Loss when the \\nhedged item affects profit or loss or is \\ntreated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in \\nthe recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or \\nNon-Financial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments \\nto mitigate the risk of movement in \\ninterest rates and foreign exchange rates \\nfor foreign exchange exposure on highly \\nprobable future cash flows attributable to \\na recognised asset or liability or forecast \\ncash transactions.\\n    When a derivative is designated as a cash \\nflow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of \\nthe derivative is recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve being part of Other \\nComprehensive Income. Any ineffective \\nportion of changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative is recognised immediately in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging \\nrelationship no longer meets the criteria for \\nhedge accounting, then hedge accounting \\nis discontinued prospectively. If the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold or terminated \\nor exercised, the cumulative gain or loss \\non the hedging instrument recognised in \\ncash flow hedging reserve till the period \\nthe hedge was effective remains in cash \\nflow hedging reserve until the underlying \\ntransaction occurs. The cumulative gain \\nor loss previously recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve is transferred to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss upon the \\noccurrence of the underlying transaction. \\nIf the forecasted transaction is no longer \\nexpected to occur, then the amount \\naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve \\nis reclassified in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n  B. Fair Value Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/Liabilities as hedging instruments \\nto mitigate the risk of change in fair value \\nof hedged item due to movement in \\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates and \\ncommodity prices.\\n    Changes in the fair value of hedging \\ninstruments and hedged items that are \\ndesignated and qualify as fair value hedges \\nare recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. If the hedging relationship no longer \\nmeets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nthe adjustment to the carrying amount of a \\nhedged item for which the effective interest \\nmethod is used is amortised to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss over the period of maturity.\\n  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n    The Company derecognises a Financial \\nAsset when the contractual rights to the \\ncash flows from the Financial Asset expire \\nor it transfers the Financial Asset and the \\ntransfer qualifies for derecognition under \\nInd AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part \\nof a Financial liability) is derecognised \\nfrom the Company’s Balance Sheet when \\nthe obligation specified in the contract is \\ndischarged or cancelled or expires.  v.  Offsetting\\n    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \\nCompany has a legally enforceable right to \\nset off the amount and it intends, either to \\nsettle them on a net basis or to realise the \\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\n (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-current assets are classified as held for \\nsale if their carrying amount will be recovered \\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use and sale is considered \\nhighly probable.\\n   A sale is considered as highly probable when \\ndecision has been made to sell, assets are \\navailable for immediate sale in its present \\ncondition, assets are being actively marketed \\nand sale has been agreed or is expected to \\nbe concluded within 12 months of the date \\nof classification.\\n   Non-current assets held for sale are neither \\ndepreciated nor amortised.\\n   Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of their carrying amount \\nand fair value less cost of disposal and are \\npresented separately in the Balance Sheet.\\n (s) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Company has adopted Successful Efforts \\nMethod (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas \\nactivities. The policy of recognition of exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure is considered in \\nline with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, \\ngeological and geophysical studies, petroleum \\nexploration license fees and general and \\nadministration costs directly attributable to \\nexploration and evaluation activities are expensed \\noff.

The reserve review and evaluation is \\ncarried out annually.\\n   Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature \\nof joint operations. Accordingly, assets and \\nliabilities as well as income and expenditure are \\naccounted on the basis of available information \\non a line-by-line basis with similar items in the \\nCompany’s Financial Statements, according to \\nthe participating interest of the Company.\\n (t) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures \\nused in determination of basic earnings per share \\nto take into account the conversion of all dilutive \\npotential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity \\nshares are deemed converted as at the beginning \\nof the period unless issued at a later date.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements\\xa0and \\nKey Sources Of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Company’s Financial \\nStatements requires management to make \\njudgement, estimates and assumptions that affect \\nthe reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets \\nand liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. \\nUncertainty about these assumptions and estimates \\ncould result in outcomes that require a material \\nadjustment to the carrying amount of assets or \\nliabilities affected in next financial years.\\n(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Company’s estimates of \\nits oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases \\nit’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement \\nof reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and \\ncommercial assessments based on conventional \\nindustry practice and regulatory requirements.\\n  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \\nto calculate depletion charges for the Company’s \\noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \\nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the \\nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \\nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \\nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \\nvalues reported in the Financial Statements.\\n  Details on proved reserves and production both \\non product and geographical basis are provided in \\nNote\\xa036.2.\\n(B) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs is recognised \\nwhen the Company has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include; the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.\\n(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible \\nAssets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating \\nin the manner intended by the management. \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are \\ndepreciated/amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife, after taking into account estimated residual \\nvalue. Management reviews the estimated useful life \\nand residual values of the assets annually in order to \\ndetermine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation \\nto be recorded during any reporting period. The \\nuseful life and residual values are based on the \\nCompany’s historical experience with similar assets \\nand take into account anticipated technological and \\nfuture risks. The depreciation/amortisation for future \\nperiods is revised if there are significant changes from \\nprevious estimates.\\n(D)  Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgments are required in assessing the recoverability \\nof overdue trade receivables and determining whether \\na provision against those receivables is required. \\nFactors considered include the credit rating of the \\ncounterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated \\nfuture payments and any possible actions that can be \\ntaken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\\n(E) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of the \\nliability (including litigations) requires the application \\nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, \\nwhich can be subject to change. The carrying \\namounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing \\nfacts and circumstances.\\n(F)  Impairment of Financial and \\nNon-Financial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \\nare based on assumptions about risk of default \\nand expected cash loss rates. The Company uses \\njudgement in making these assumptions and \\nselecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, \\nbased on Company’s past history, existing market \\nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the \\nend of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, assessment of \\nimpairment indicators involves consideration of \\nfuture risks. Further, the company estimates asset’s \\nrecoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or \\nCash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of \\ndisposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less \\ncosts of disposal, recent market transactions are taken \\ninto account, if no such transactions can be identified, \\nan appropriate valuation model is used.\\n(G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and \\nLiabilities\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses for \\nwhich there is probability of utilisation against the \\nfuture taxable profit. The Company uses judgement \\nto determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level \\nof future taxable profits and business developments.\\n(H) Fair Value Measurement\\n  For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer note 39 of financial statements.\\nD.

The above information \\nis certified by the actuary.\\nThe Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the \\ncomposition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Company’s policy for \\nPlan Assets Management.\\n  VII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with FY 2022-23.\\n  VIII) Sensitivity Analysis\\n    Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected \\nsalary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably \\npossible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions \\nconstant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:\\nAs at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022\\nDecrease Increase Decrease Increase\\nChange in rate of discounting (delta effect of +/- 0.5%) 21 22 24 26\\nChange in rate of salary increase (delta effect of -/+ 0.5%) 22 23 25 26\\nChange in rate of employee turnover (delta effect of -/+ \\n0.5%)2 2 2 2    These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and \\nSalary Risk.\\nInvestment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is \\ndetermined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\\nInterest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset \\nby an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.\\nLongevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate \\nof the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life \\nexpectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\\nSalary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan \\nparticipants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\\n 29.2 Share Based Payments\\n  a) Scheme details\\n    The Company has Employees’ Stock Option Scheme i.e. ESOS-2017 under which options have been granted at the \\nexercise price of C 10 per share to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility criteria. \\nDetails of number of options outstanding have been tabulated below: \\nFinancial Year\\n(Year of Grant)Number of Options Outstanding\\nFinancial Year of VestingExercise  \\nPrice ( K)Range of Fair value at \\nGrant Date ( K)As at  \\n31st March 2023As at  \\n31st March 2022\\nESOS - 2017\\nDetails of Employee Stock Options granted from 1st April, 2020 to 31st March, 2023\\n2020-21 2,00,000 3,00,000 2021-22 to 2024-25 10.00 2,133.40 -2,151.90\\n2021-22 90,000 90,000 2022-23 to 2025-26 10.00 2,595.20-2,613.30\\nTotal 2,90,000 3,90,000\\nExercise period would commence from the date of Vesting and would expire not later than seven years from the Grant \\nDate or such other period as may be decided by the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee of \\nthe Board.\\n  b) Fair Value on the grant date\\n    The fair value at grant date is determined using “Black Scholes Model” which takes into account the exercise price, \\nterm of the option, share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying shares, expected dividend \\nyield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.\\n    The model inputs for options granted during the year ended 31st March, 2021 and 31st March, 2022 included as \\nmentioned below.\\n            ESOS - 2017\\na) Weighted average exercise price C 10 C 10\\nb) Grant date: 05.10.2020 30.03.2022\\nc) Vesting year: 2021-22 to 2024-25 2022-23 to 2025-26\\nd) Share Price at grant date: C 2,212 C 2,673\\ne) Expected price volatility of Company's share: 30.2% to 31.9% 30.7% to 33%\\nf) Expected dividend yield: 0.60% 0.49%\\ng) Risk free interest rate: 5.1% to 5.6% 5.86% to 6.34%\\nThe expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility (based on remaining life of the options).Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n364 365\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the \\nterms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined \\nin the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI \\nof $\\xa0165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional \\nProfit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023. \\nThe next date of hearing is awaited.   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified \\nthe New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to \\ninstruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under \\nthe guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be \\ncredited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool \\nAccount is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\\n 36.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately \\nUS$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on \\nbehalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair \\nclaim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an appeal \\non 15th\\xa0November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the \\nFinal Award of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the \\nArbitration Award dated 24th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI’s appeal.\\n  (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) \\nagainst GOI on 16th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts (‘PSCs’) for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks \\ndue to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by \\nmajority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, \\n2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on \\n16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral \\nTribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1st October, 2018 (‘2018 \\nFPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English \\nCommercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and \\nremitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable \\naward on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements \\nCase Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application \\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral \\nTribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which \\nwill take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. \\n    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and \\nexecution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The \\nClaimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition \\nbefore the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon’ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking \\nenforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) \\nrelating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\\n  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for \\na\\xa0period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses \\nin the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\\n    Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ \\nlitigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\\n 36.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\\n   The following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to \\nactivity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticularsAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\nExploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost\\nExploration Expenditure written off - 102\\nOther Exploration Cost 4 79\\nExploration Cost for the year 4 181Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n388 389\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

By an \\norder dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the \\n‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and \\n(ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till \\nthe date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) \\nagainst this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged \\namount within sixty days from the date of the order.

Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates.

Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives \\nand receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate \\ncreditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit \\ninformation is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify \\nand respond to cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, \\nadvance payments and factoring & forfeiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The \\ncompany restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.  iv) Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company \\nmaintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global \\nand local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to \\nensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts \\nof the company’s cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times \\nincluding contingencies.\\n    The company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. \\nTreasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net \\ndeficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank \\ndeposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified \\nto\\xa0avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@12,633 7,389 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 1,80,499\\nCurrent $33,985 2,387 - - - - 36,372\\nTotal 46,618 9,776 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 2,16,871\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 81 81 161 587 552 4,301 5,763\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 645 389 314 71 4 - 1,423\\nOptions 103 20 63 35 - - 221\\nInterest Rate Swaps 3 13 44 38 46 3 147\\nTotal 751 422 421 144 50 3 1,791\\n^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) C 1,10,722 crore.\\n* Include C 1,048 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges and fair valuation impact.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.2).\\n$ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 5.6% to 8.5%.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@2,169 6,416 9,517 74,969 32,724 60,399 1,86,194\\nCurrent #$9,328 90 - - - - 9,418\\nTotal 11,497 6,506 9,517 74,969 32,724 60,399 1,95,612\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 85 79 148 552 552 4,577 5,993\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 3,033 601 677 390 - - 4,701\\nOptions 151 2 20 - - - 173\\nInterest Rate Swaps - - 4 43 30 - 77\\nTotal 3,184 603 701 433 30 - 4,951\\n^  Does not include Trade Payables (Current) C 1,34,005 crore.\\n* Include C 1,029 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon.\\n# Include C 20 crore of Commercial Paper Discount.\\n$ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 2.5% to 8.6%.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n394 395\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Hedge Accounting\\n   The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and \\nother feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a \\nstructured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting \\nframework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and \\noptions, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established \\na hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical \\nderivative method and critical term matching method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n  Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\\n  A.

These matters were addressed in the context \\nof our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as \\na whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do \\nnot provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have \\ndetermined the matters described below to be the key \\naudit matters to be communicated in our report.\\nSr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n1.Estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves\\nSignificant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating \\noil and gas reserves which require consideration of factors \\nsuch as the availability of geological and engineering data, \\nreservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells and commodity prices. The quantum of \\noil and gas reserves have a direct impact on determination of \\ndepletion charge for the Parent's oil and gas assets and on \\nthe assessment of the recoverability of the carrying values of \\ndevelopment rights. \\nAccordingly, the estimation of oil and gas reserves has been \\nconsidered as a key audit matter in view of the significant \\njudgements and estimates involved. \\nRefer Notes B.3 (e) and C(A) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the \\nfollowing:-\\n• Performed walk-through of the estimation process \\nassociated with the oil and gas reserves. Tested the design, \\nimplementation and operating effectiveness of the controls \\nestablished by the Parent  in the process of estimation of oil and \\ngas reserves.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent's  \\ninternal specialists involved in estimating oil and gas reserves.\\n• Performed substantive testing of the depletion computation. \\nInvolved internal specialists to assess the reasonableness of \\nvaluation assumptions and appropriateness of the valuation \\nmethodology used in assessing the recoverability of the \\ncarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets included in \\nintangible assets under development.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for compliance with the \\napplicable authoritative pronouncements.Sr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n2.Depreciation / amortisation of spectrum and related \\ntangible assets\\nThe auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), a \\nstep-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported a key audit \\nmatter on amortization / depreciation of spectrum costs and \\nrelated tangible assets. Spectrum costs and the related tangible \\nassets are amortised / depreciated to appropriately reflect the \\nexpected pattern of consumption of expected future economic \\nbenefits from continued use of the said assets. Determination \\nof rate of amortisation / depreciation involves significant \\njudgement and estimates and use of technology. Accordingly, \\nit has been considered as a key audit matter. \\nRefer Notes B.3 (e) and C(C) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors of \\nRJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by \\nthe auditors of RJIL to address the key audit matter. As reported \\nby the subsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been \\nperformed by them:-\\n• Tested design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls over determination of expected economic benefits \\nfrom the use of relevant assets and monitoring actual \\nconsumption thereof to true-up the expected pattern of \\nconsumption during an accounting period.\\n• Involved internal Telecom and IT specialists to assess the \\nreasonableness of the expected pattern of consumption \\nof the expected economic benefits emanating from the \\nuse of the relevant assets and the IT environment over the \\nrelevant application systems used in monitoring the actual \\nconsumption thereof.\\n• Substantive testing procedures included, verifying the \\nmathematical accuracy of computation of amortisation /\\ndepreciation charge for the year.\\n3.Litigation matters\\nThe Parent has certain significant ongoing legal proceedings \\nfor various complex matters with the Government of India and \\nother parties, continuing from earlier years, which are as under:\\n1. Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:\\n (a)  Disallowance of certain costs under the production \\nsharing contract, relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 \\nand consequent deposit of differential revenue on \\ngas sales from D1D3 field to the gas pool account \\nmaintained by Gail (India) Limited. \\n (b)   Claim against the Parent in respect of gas said to \\nhave migrated from neighbouring blocks (KGD6).\\n (c)   Claims relating to limits of cost recovery, profit \\nsharing and audit and accounting provisions of the \\npublic sector corporations etc., arising under two \\nproduction sharing contracts entered into in 1994. \\n (d)   Suit for specific performance of a contract for \\nsupply of natural gas before the Hon’ble Bombay \\nHigh Court. \\n  Refer Notes 35.3 and 35.4 to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n2.   Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance \\nPetroleum Limited (‘RPL’):\\n  Securities Appellate Tribunal judgement dated November \\n5, 2020, dismissing the Parent's  appeal made in relation \\nto Order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board \\nof India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 \\nin connection with trades by the Parent in the stock \\nexchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum \\nLimited, then subsidiary of the Parent.\\n  Refer Note 36 (III) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, \\nmanagement’s judgement regarding recognition, \\nmeasurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal \\nproceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over \\ntime as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.\\n Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the \\nfollowing:-\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof the controls established by the Parent  in the process of \\nevaluation of litigation matters.\\n• Assessed the management’s position through discussions \\nwith the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions \\nobtained by the Parent  (where considered necessary) on both, \\nthe probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the \\nmagnitude of any potential loss.\\n• Discussed with the management on the developments in \\nrespect of these litigations during the year ended 31st March \\n2023 till the date of approval of the Parent's Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n• Rolled out enquiry letters to the Parent's  legal counsel and \\nassessed the responses received.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent's  legal \\ncounsel involved in the process.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n• Obtained Management Representation Letter on the \\nassessment of these matters.\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\n402 403\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Further, \\nthe fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern \\nof future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets). \\nAccordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. \\nRefer Notes 2 and 38A to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:-\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof the controls established by the Parent in the process of \\ndetermination of fair value of the investments.\\n• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the \\nmanagement by involvement of internal valuation specialists.\\n• Assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts \\nincluding discount rates, expected growth rates and its \\neffect on business and terminal growth rates used and the \\nvaluation methodology inter-alia through involvement of the \\ninternal specialists.\\n• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared \\nto previous year / actual performance with management \\nto evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash \\nflow forecasts.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal \\nspecialist and Parent ’s external experts involved in the process.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards the \\nfair valuation of these investments.\\n5.Revenue Recognition\\n(a)  The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), \\na step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported \\nrevenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high \\nvolumes of data processed by the IT systems and the \\ncomplexity of those IT systems.In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors \\nof RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed \\nby them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the \\nsubsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been performed \\nby them:-\\n• Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and \\noperating effectiveness of the relevant business process \\ncontrols, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement \\nand authorization of revenue transactions, involving internal \\nInformation Technology (IT) specialists for the automated \\ncontrols, interface controls and reports generated through \\nvarious relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.\\n• Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment \\ninter-alia for access controls, change management and \\napplication specific controls in the IT Systems over the \\nCompany's billing and other relevant support systems.\\n• Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue \\nper the billing system and the financial records. Performed \\nprocedures to test the computation of revenue and \\ndeferred revenue.\\n(b)  The auditors of Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’), a step-\\ndown subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue \\nrecognition as a key audit matter. RRL is engaged in \\norganised retail and the trading transactions generating \\nrevenue comprise of high volume of individually small \\ntransactions which increases the risk of revenue being \\nrecognised inappropriately and which highlights the \\ncriticality of sound internal processes of summarising \\nand recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption \\nbaskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of \\nconsideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised \\non transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. \\nTransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or \\ncash equivalent from customers. In view of the above \\nand since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, \\nrevenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \\nRRL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by \\nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \\nauditors, the following procedure have been performed by them:-\\n• Obtained understanding of the process followed by the \\nmanagement to record the revenue from each store.\\n• Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \\nthe internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of \\nrevenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.\\n• Involved information technology specialist to test the \\nautomated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation \\nof revenue.\\n• On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various \\ndates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue recorded \\nthrough various modes of payment from RRL’s accounting \\nsystem. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such details with \\nthe underlying collection made by RRL as per cash receipts, \\nmerchant payment reports, and other third party supporting.Sr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n6.Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant on \\nIT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \\nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \\nconsumption.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted \\nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the \\nbasis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section \\n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing \\nour opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal \\nfinancial controls system in place and the operating \\neffectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by the management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \\nmay cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group \\nand its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty \\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \\nreport to the related disclosures in the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements or, if such disclosures are \\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of \\nour auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions \\nmay cause the Group and its associates and joint \\nventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding \\nthe financial information of the entities or business \\nactivities within the Group and its associates and joint \\nventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. We are responsible for the \\ndirection, supervision and performance of the audit of \\nthe financial statements of such entities or business \\nactivities included in the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of which we are the independent auditors. \\nFor the other entities or business activities included \\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have \\nbeen audited by the other auditors, such other auditors \\nremain responsible for the direction, supervision and \\nperformance of the audits carried out by them.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that \\nthe internal financial control with reference to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements may become inadequate because of \\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance \\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nOpinion\\nIn our opinion to the best of our information and \\naccording to the explanations given to us and based on \\nthe consideration of the reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the \\nParent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies \\nand joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in \\nIndia, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements and such internal financial controls with \\nreference to Consolidated Financial Statements were \\noperating effectively as at 31st March, 2023, based on \\nthe criteria for internal financial control with reference \\nto Consolidated Financial Statements established by \\nthe respective companies considering the essential \\ncomponents of internal control stated in the Guidance \\nNote on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial \\nReporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants \\nof India.\\nOther Matters\\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on \\nthe adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements insofar as it relates to 123 subsidiary companies, \\n36 associate companies and 15 joint ventures, which are \\ncompanies incorporated in India, is based solely on the \\ncorresponding reports of the auditors of such companies \\nincorporated in India.\\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of the \\nabove matters.\\nFor Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\\nChartered Accountants\\nFirm’s Registration No. 117366W/W-100018\\nAbhijit A.

Significant Accounting Policies\\nB.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been \\nprepared on the historical cost basis except for the \\nfollowing assets and liabilities which have been \\nmeasured at fair value:\\n i.  Certain financial assets and liabilities (including \\nderivative instruments),\\n ii. Defined Benefit Plan’s – Plan Assets and\\n iii. Equity settled Share Based Payments\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements of the \\nGroup have been prepared in accordance with \\nIndian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under \\nthe Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \\nRules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and \\npresentation requirements of Division II of Schedule \\nIII to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant \\nSchedule III), as applicable to the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprises \\nof Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, \\nbeing the entities that it controls. Control is assessed \\nin accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 – \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented \\nin Indian Rupees ( C) and all values are rounded \\nto the nearest crore ( C 00,00,000), except when \\notherwise indicated.\\nB.2 Principles of Consolidation\\n (a)  The financial statements of the Company and its \\nsubsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis \\nby adding together like items of assets, liabilities, \\nequity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after \\nfully eliminating intra-group balances and intra-\\ngroup transactions. (b)  Profits or losses resulting from intra-group  \\ntransactions that are recognised in assets, such \\nas Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, \\nare eliminated in full.\\n (c)  In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are \\nconsolidated at the average rate prevailing during \\nthe year. All assets and liabilities are converted \\nat rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any \\nexchange difference arising on consolidation is \\nrecognised in the Foreign Currency Translation \\nReserve (FCTR).\\n (d)  The audited/unaudited financial statements of \\nforeign subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates \\nhave been prepared in accordance with the \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principle of its \\nCountry of Incorporation or Ind AS.\\n (e)  The differences in accounting policies of the \\nCompany and its subsidiaries/joint ventures/ \\nassociates are not material and there are no \\nmaterial transactions from 1st January, 2023 to \\n31st March, 2023 in respect of subsidiaries/joint \\nventures/associates having financial year ended \\n31st\\xa0December, 2022.\\n (f)  The Consolidated Financial Statements have \\nbeen prepared using uniform accounting \\npolicies for like transactions and other events in \\nsimilar circumstances.\\n (g)  The carrying amount of the parent’s investment \\nin each subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against \\nthe parent’s portion of equity in each subsidiary.\\n (h)  The difference between the proceeds from \\ndisposal of investment in subsidiaries and the \\ncarrying amount of its assets less liabilities as \\non the date of disposal is recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being \\nthe profit or loss on disposal of investment \\nin subsidiary.\\n (i)  Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has \\nbeen accounted under the Equity Method as per \\nInd AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint \\nVentures. Investments in joint operations are \\naccounted using the Proportionate Consolidation \\nMethod as per Ind AS 111 – Joint Arrangements.\\n (j)  The Group accounts for its share of post-\\nacquisition changes in net assets of associates \\nand joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised \\nprofits and losses resulting from transactions \\nbetween the Group and its associates and \\njoint ventures.\\n (k)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of profit/loss of \\nconsolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified \\nand adjusted against the income of the Group in \\norder to arrive at the net income attributable to \\nshareholders of the Company. (l)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of net assets \\nof consolidated subsidiaries is identified and \\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\nB.3  Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies\\n (a) Current and Non-Current Classification\\n   The Group presents assets and liabilities in \\nthe Balance Sheet based on Current/Non-\\nCurrent classification.\\n  An asset is treated as Current when it is –\\n  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be \\nsold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\\n  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  Expected to be realised within twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period, or\\n  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted \\nfrom being exchanged or used to settle a \\nliability for at least twelve months after the \\nreporting period.\\n  All other assets are classified as Non-Current.\\n  A liability is treated as Current when –\\n  -  It is expected to be settled in normal \\noperating cycle;\\n  -  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period.\\n   The Group classifies all other liabilities as \\nNon-Current.\\n   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified \\nas Non-Current Assets and Liabilities.\\n (b) Business Combination\\n   Business Combinations are accounted for using \\nthe acquisition method of accounting, except \\nfor common control transactions which are \\naccounted using the pooling of interest method \\nthat is accounted at carrying values.\\n   The cost of an acquisition is measured at the \\nfair value of the assets transferred, equity \\ninstruments issued and liabilities assumed at \\ntheir acquisition date i.e. the date on which \\ncontrol is acquired. Contingent consideration \\nto be transferred is recognised at fair value \\nand included as part of cost of acquisition. \\nTransaction related costs are expensed in the \\nperiod in which the costs are incurred.   For each business combination, the Group \\nelects whether to measure the non-controlling \\ninterests in the acquiree at fair value or at the \\nproportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable \\nnet assets.\\n   Goodwill arising on business combination is \\ninitially measured at cost, being the excess of \\nthe aggregate of the consideration transferred \\nand the amount recognised for non-controlling \\ninterests, and any previous interest held, over \\nthe fair value of net identifiable assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually \\nand measured at cost less any accumulated \\nimpairment losses if any.\\n   Common control business combination: Business \\ncombinations involving entities or businesses that \\nare controlled by the group are accounted using \\nthe pooling of interest method.\\n (c) Property, Plant and Equipment\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at \\ncost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount \\nand rebates less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing cost and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets \\nto its working condition for its intended use, \\nnet charges on foreign exchange contracts \\nand adjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the assets. In case of \\nland the Group has availed fair value as deemed \\ncost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment \\nwhich are significant to the total cost of that item \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment and having \\ndifferent useful life are accounted separately. \\nOther Indirect Expenses incurred relating to \\nproject, net of income earned during the project \\ndevelopment stage prior to its intended use, \\nare considered as pre-operative expenses and \\ndisclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\\n   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment \\nis provided using written down value method \\non depreciable amount except in case of certain \\nassets of Oil to Chemicals and other segment \\nwhich are depreciated using straight line method. \\nDepreciation on wireless telecommunications \\nequipment and components is determined based \\non the expected pattern of consumption of the \\nexpected future economic benefits.

Gains or \\nlosses arising from derecognition of a Property, \\nPlant and Equipment are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n (d) Leases\\n   The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of-\\nuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing \\narrangements, if the contract conveys the right to \\ncontrol the use of an identified asset.\\n   The contract conveys the right to control the \\nuse of an identified asset, if it involves the \\nuse of an identified asset and the Group has \\nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from \\nuse of the asset and has right to direct the use \\nof the identified asset. The cost of the right-\\nof-use asset shall comprise of the amount of \\nthe initial measurement of the lease liability \\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or \\nbefore the commencement date plus any \\ninitial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use \\nassets is subsequently measured at cost less \\nany accumulated depreciation/amortisation, \\naccumulated impairment losses, if any and \\nadjusted for any remeasurement of the lease \\nliability. The right -of-use asset is depreciated/\\namortised using the straight-line method from \\nthe commencement date over the shorter of \\nlease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\\n   The Group measures the lease liability at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at the commencement date of the lease. \\nThe lease payments are discounted using the \\ninterest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can \\nbe readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental \\nborrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the Group \\nrecognises the lease payments as an operating \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the \\nlease term.\\n   The Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as \\nan operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are \\nclassified as finance lease whenever the terms \\nof the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases.\\n (e) Other Intangible Assets\\n   Other Intangible Assets are stated at cost of \\nacquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade \\ndiscount and rebates less accumulated \\namortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if \\nany. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing \\ncosts, and any cost directly attributable for \\npreparing the asset for its intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the Other Intangible \\nAssets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, \\nthe Group has availed fair value as deemed cost \\non the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of \\nan Other Intangible Asset are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n   The Group’s Other Intangible Assets include \\nassets with finite and indefinite useful life. \\nAssets with finite useful life are amortised on a \\nstraight-line basis over their expected useful life \\nand assets with indefinite useful lives are not \\namortised but are tested for impairment annually \\nat the cash generating unit level.\\n   A summary of the amortisation/depletion policies \\napplied to the Group’s Other Intangible Assets to \\nthe extent of depreciable amount is as follows.Particulars Depreciation\\nT echnical \\nKnow-HowOver the useful life of the underlying \\nassets ranging from 5 years to 35 years\\nComputer \\nSoftwareOver a period of 5 to 10 years.\\nDevelopment \\nRightsW.r.t.

Development \\ncosts are capitalised as an intangible asset if it \\ncan be demonstrated that the project is expected \\nto generate future economic benefits, it is \\nprobable that those future economic benefits \\nwill flow to the entity and the costs of the asset \\ncan be measured reliably, else it is charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n (g) Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n   Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash \\non hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and \\nshort-term highly liquid investments that are \\nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash \\nand which are subject to an insignificant risk of \\nchanges in value.\\n (h) Finance Costs\\n   Borrowing costs include exchange differences \\narising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the \\ninterest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised as part of \\nthe cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is \\none that necessarily takes substantial period of \\ntime to get ready for its intended use. Interest \\nincome earned on the temporary investment of \\nspecific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing \\ncosts eligible for capitalisation.\\n   All other borrowing costs are charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for \\nthe period for which they are incurred.\\n (i) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing \\nfor obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-\\nproducts which are valued at net realisable value. \\nCost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, \\ncost of conversion and other costs including \\nmanufacturing overheads net of recoverable \\ntaxes incurred in bringing them to their \\nrespective present location and condition. Cost of \\nfinished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, \\nchemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, \\ntrading and other products are determined on \\nweighted average basis.\\n (j)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets — \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill \\nand Other Intangible Assets\\n   The Group assesses at each reporting date as to \\nwhether there is any indication that any Property, \\nPlant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other \\nIntangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash \\nGenerating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any \\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount \\nof an asset or CGU is estimated to determine \\nthe extent of impairment, if any. When it is not \\npossible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, the Group estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the CGU to which the \\nasset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to \\nthe extent, asset’s carrying amount exceeds its \\nrecoverable amount. The recoverable amount \\nis higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of \\ndisposal and value in use.

If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Group records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding \\nof discount is recognised in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n (l) Contingent Liability\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \\nor more uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \\neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \\nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\\n (m) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term \\nemployee benefits expected to be paid in \\nexchange for the services rendered by employees \\nare recognised as an expense during the period \\nwhen the employees render the services.  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Group recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related service. \\nIf the contribution payable to the scheme for \\nservice received before the balance sheet date \\nexceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit \\npayable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. \\nIf the contribution already paid exceeds the \\ncontribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date, then excess is recognised \\nas an asset to the extent that the pre-payment \\nwill lead to, for example, a reduction in future \\npayment or refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Group pays gratuity to the employees \\nwho have completed five years of service at \\nthe time of resignation/superannuation. The \\ngratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every \\ncompleted year of service as per the Payment of \\nGratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount \\nis contributed to the approved gratuity fund \\nformed exclusively for gratuity payment to the \\nemployees. The gratuity fund has been approved \\nby respective Income Tax authorities. The liability \\nin respect of gratuity and other post-employment \\nbenefits is calculated using the Projected Unit \\nCredit Method and spread over the period during \\nwhich the benefit is expected to be derived from \\nemployees’ services.\\n   Remeasurement gains and losses arising \\nfrom adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in \\nthe period in which they occur, in Other \\nComprehensive Income.\\n  Employee Separation Costs\\n   The Group recognises the employee separation \\ncost when the scheme is announced and the \\nGroup is demonstrably committed to it.\\n (n) Tax Expenses\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprises of \\nCurrent Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is \\nrecognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, except to the extent that it relates to \\nitems recognised in the Other Comprehensive \\nIncome. In which case, the tax is also recognised \\nin Other Comprehensive Income.\\n  i. Current Tax\\n    Current tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the amount expected to be \\nrecovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that \\nare enacted at the Balance sheet date.\\n  ii. Deferred Tax\\n    Deferred Tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities in the financial \\nstatements and the corresponding tax \\nbases used in the computation of taxable \\nprofit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised \\nto the extent it is probable that taxable \\nprofit will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary differences, and the \\ncarry forward of unused tax losses can be \\nutilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets \\nare measured at the tax rates that are \\nexpected to apply in the period in which \\nthe liability is settled or the asset realised, \\nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have \\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted \\nby the end of the reporting period. The \\ncarrying amount of deferred tax liabilities \\nand assets are reviewed at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n (o) Share Based Payments\\n   Equity-settled share based payments to \\nemployees and others providing similar services \\nare measured at the fair value of the equity \\ninstruments at the grant date. Details regarding \\nthe determination of the fair value of equity-\\nsettled share based payments transactions are \\nset out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined \\nat the grant date of the equity-settled share \\nbased payments is expensed on a straight line \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the \\nGroup’s estimate of equity instruments that will \\neventually vest, with a corresponding increase \\nin equity. At the end of each reporting period, \\nthe Group revises its estimate of the number \\nof equity instruments expected to vest. The \\nimpact of the revision of the original estimates, \\nif any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative \\nexpenses reflects the revised estimate, with a \\ncorresponding adjustment to the Share Based \\nPayments Reserve. The dilutive effect of \\noutstanding options is reflected as additional \\nshare dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\n (p)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded \\nat the exchange rate prevailing on the date \\nof transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency’s closing rates of \\nexchange at the reporting date.\\n   Exchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except \\nto the extent of exchange differences which are \\nregarded as an adjustment to interest costs on \\nforeign currency borrowings that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of \\nassets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on \\nforeign currency borrowings taken prior to April \\n1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or \\nconstruction of qualifying assets are adjusted in \\nthe carrying cost of such assets.\\n   Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are \\nrecorded using the exchange rates at the date of \\nthe transaction. Non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value in a foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rates at the date when the \\nfair value was measured. The gain or loss arising \\non translation of non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value is treated in line with the recognition \\nof the gain or loss on the change in fair value \\nof the item (i.e. translation differences on items \\nwhose fair value gain or loss is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income or Statement \\nof Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income or Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where a \\nnon-monetary advance is paid/received, the date \\nof transaction is the date on which the advance \\nwas initially recognised. If there were multiple \\npayments or receipts in advance, multiple dates \\nof transactions are determined for each payment \\nor receipt of advance consideration.\\n (q) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or \\nservices are transferred to the customer at an \\namount that reflects the consideration entitled in \\nexchange for those goods or services. The Group \\nis generally the principal as it typically controls \\nthe goods or services before transferring them to \\nthe customer.\\n   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment \\nof goods to the customer or when the goods \\nis made available to the customer, provided \\ntransfer of title to the customer occurs and the \\nGroup has not retained any significant risks of \\nownership or future obligations with respect to \\nthe goods shipped.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n424 425\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Consideration is determined \\nbased on its most likely amount.\\n   Generally, sales of petroleum products contain \\nprovisional pricing features where revenue is \\ninitially recognised based on provisional price. \\nDifference between final settlement price and \\nprovisional price is recognised subsequently.\\n   The Group does not adjust short-term advances \\nreceived from the customer for the effects of \\nsignificant financing component if it is expected \\nat the contract inception that the promised good \\nor service will be transferred to the customer \\nwithin a period of one year.\\n  Contract Balances\\n  Trade Receivables\\n   A receivable represents the Group’s right to an \\namount of consideration that is unconditional.\\n  Contract Liabilities\\n   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer \\ngoods or services to a customer for which the \\nGroup has received consideration or is due from \\nthe customer. If a customer pays consideration \\nbefore the Group transfers goods or services to \\nthe customer, a contract liability is recognised \\nwhen the payment is made or the payment is \\ndue (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are \\nrecognised as revenue when the Group performs \\nunder the contract.  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a financial asset is \\nrecognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s \\nright to receive the amount has been established.\\n (r) Financial Instruments\\n  i.  Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nfinancial assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the \\nfair value on initial recognition. Purchase \\nand sale of financial assets are recognised \\nusing trade date accounting. However, trade \\nreceivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at \\ntransaction price.  \\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n  a)  Financial assets measured at Amortised \\nCost (AC)\\n    A financial asset is measured at Amortised \\nCost if it is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold the asset in \\norder to collect contractual cash flows \\nand the contractual terms of the financial \\nasset give rise to cash flows on specified \\ndates that represent solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n  b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Other Comprehensive Income \\n(FVTOCI)\\n    A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI \\nif it is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is achieved by both collecting \\ncontractual cash flows and selling financial \\nassets and the contractual terms of the \\nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to \\ncash flows that represent solely payments \\nof principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n  c)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\\n    A financial asset which is not classified in \\nany of the above categories are measured \\nat FVTPL.\\n    Financial assets are reclassified subsequent \\nto their recognition, if the Group changes its business model for managing those \\nfinancial assets. Changes in business model \\nare made and applied prospectively from \\nthe reclassification date following the \\nchanges in business model in accordance \\nwith principles laid down under Ind AS 109 \\n– Financial Instruments.\\n  C. Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Consolidated Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, except for those equity investments \\nfor which the Group has elected to present \\nthe value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’.\\n    However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments is recognised in Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the Company’s right \\nto receive payment is established.\\n  D. Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group \\nuses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for \\nevaluating impairment of financial assets \\nother than those measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected \\nCredit Losses are measured through a loss \\nallowance at an amount equal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For trade receivables, the Group applies \\n‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \\nThe Group uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Group uses 12 month \\nExpected Credit Loss to provide for \\nimpairment loss where there is no significant \\nincrease in credit risk. If there is significant \\nincrease in credit risk full lifetime Expected \\nCredit Loss is used.  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial liabilities are recognised at fair \\nvalue and in case of borrowings, net of \\ndirectly attributable cost. Fees of recurring \\nnature are directly recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \\nas finance cost.\\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within \\none year from the balance sheet date, the \\ncarrying amounts approximate fair value due \\nto the short maturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Group uses various derivative financial \\ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \\ncurrency swaps, forwards and options and \\ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk \\nof changes in interest rates, exchange rates \\nand commodity prices. At the inception of \\na hedge relationship, the Group formally \\ndesignates and documents the hedge \\nrelationship to which the Group wishes \\nto apply hedge accounting and the risk \\nmanagement objective and strategy for \\nundertaking the hedge. Such derivative \\nfinancial instruments are initially recognised \\nat fair value on the date on which a \\nderivative contract is entered into and \\nare also subsequently measured at fair \\nvalue. Derivatives are carried as financial \\nassets when the fair value is positive and \\nas financial liabilities when the fair value \\nis negative.\\n    Any gains or losses arising from changes \\nin the fair value of derivatives are taken \\ndirectly to Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, except for the effective portion \\nof cash flow hedge which is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income and later to \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, \\nwhen the hedged item affects profit or loss \\nor is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in \\nthe recognition of a non-financial asset or \\nnon-financial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A.

Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n    The Group derecognises a financial asset \\nwhen the contractual rights to the cash \\nflows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer \\nqualifies for derecognition under Ind AS \\n109 – Financial Instruments. A financial \\nliability (or a part of a financial liability) is \\nderecognised from the Group’s Balance \\nSheet when the obligation specified in \\nthe contract is discharged or cancelled \\nor expires.\\n  v.  Offsetting\\n    Financial assets and financial liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe Balance Sheet when, and only when, \\nthe Group has a legally enforceable right to \\nset off the amount and it intends, either to \\nsettle them on a net basis or to realise the \\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\n (s) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-Current Assets are classified as Held for \\nSale if their carrying amount will be recovered \\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use and sale is considered \\nhighly probable. A sale is considered as highly \\nprobable when decision has been made to \\nsell, assets are available for immediate sale in \\nits present condition, assets are being actively \\nmarketed and sale has been agreed or is \\nexpected to be concluded within 12 months of \\nthe date of classification. Non-current assets held \\nfor sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. \\nAssets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale \\nare measured at the lower of their carrying \\namount and fair value less cost of disposal and \\nare presented separately in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet.\\n (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Group has adopted Successful Efforts \\nMethod (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas \\nactivities. The policy of recognition of exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure is considered in \\nline with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, \\ngeological and geophysical studies, petroleum \\nexploration license fees and general and \\nadministration costs directly attributable to \\nexploration and evaluation activities are expensed \\noff. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest \\nin oil and gas blocks and on exploration and \\nevaluation other than those which are expensed \\noff are accounted for as Intangible Assets under \\nDevelopment. All development costs incurred in \\nrespect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised \\nunder Intangible Assets under Development. \\nOnce a well is ready to commence commercial \\nproduction, the costs accumulated in Intangible \\nAssets under Development are classified as \\nOther Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure which does not result \\nin discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all \\ncost pertaining to production are charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n   The Group uses technical estimation of reserves \\nas per the Petroleum Resources Management \\nSystem guidelines 2011 and standard geological \\nand reservoir engineering methods. The reserve \\nreview and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil \\nand Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint \\nOperations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as \\nwell as income and expenditure are accounted \\non the basis of available information on a line-\\nby-line basis with similar items in the financial \\nstatements, according to the participating interest \\nof the Group.\\n (u) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures \\nused in determination of basic earnings per share \\nto take into account the conversion of all dilutive \\npotential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity \\nshares are deemed converted as at the beginning \\nof the period unless issued at a later date.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements and \\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Group’s financial statements \\nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about \\nthese assumptions and estimates could result in \\noutcomes that require a material adjustment to the \\ncarrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in \\nfuture periods.\\n(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Group’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Group’s estimates of its oil \\nand natural gas reserves. The Group bases it’s proved \\nreserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable \\ncertainty with rigorous technical and commercial \\nassessments based on conventional industry practice \\nand regulatory requirements.  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \\nto calculate depletion charges for the Group’s \\noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \\nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively \\nby amortising the remaining carrying value of the \\nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \\nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \\nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \\nvalues reported in the financial statements. Details on \\nproved reserves and production both on product and \\ngeographical basis are provided in Note 35.\\n(B) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs are recognised \\nwhen the Group has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.\\n(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Other \\nIntangible Assets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \\nthe manner intended by the management. Property, \\nPlant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets are \\ndepreciated/ amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife, after taking into account estimated residual value. \\nSpectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity \\nperiod, based on the expected pattern of consumption \\nof the expected future economic benefits.\\n  Management reviews the estimated useful life and \\nresidual values of the assets annually in order to \\ndetermine the amount of depreciation/amortisation \\nto be recorded during any reporting period. The useful \\nlife and residual values are based on the Group’s \\nhistorical experience with similar assets and take into \\naccount anticipated technological and future risks. \\nThe depreciation/ amortisation for future periods \\nis revised if there are significant changes from \\nprevious estimates.\\n(D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgements are required in assessing the \\nrecoverability of overdue trade receivables and \\ndetermining whether a provision against those \\nreceivables is required. Factors considered include \\nthe credit rating of the counterparty, the amount \\nand timing of anticipated future payments and any \\npossible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk \\nof non-payment.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n428 429\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Cash flow projections \\nare discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the \\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which \\nranges from 8% to 12%.\\n  The Management believes that any reasonably \\npossible change in the above key assumptions \\non which recoverable amount is based would not \\ncause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the \\naggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.\\n(G)  Impairment of Financial and \\nNon-Financial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are \\nbased on assumptions about risk of default and \\nexpected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement \\nin making these assumptions and selecting the inputs \\nto the impairment calculation, based on Group’s past \\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-\\nlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates \\nasset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an \\nasset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less \\ncosts of disposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less \\ncosts of disposal, recent market transactions are taken \\ninto account, if no such transactions can be identified, \\nan appropriate valuation model is used.  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives \\nhave been allocated to the respective CGUs which are \\ndetermined at the entity level. During the year ended \\nMarch 31, 2023, the Group has determined that there \\nis no impairment towards these assets.\\n(H)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and \\nLiabilities\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses for \\nwhich there is probability of utilisation against the \\nfuture taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to \\ndetermine the amount of deferred tax that can be \\nrecognised, based upon the likely timing and the level \\nof future taxable profits and business developments.\\n(I) Fair Value Measurement\\n  For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer Note 38 of financial statements.\\n(J) Revenue\\n  The application of Accounting Standard on \\nRevenue Recognition for digital segment involves \\ncomplexity and use of key judgements with respect \\nto multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue \\nrecognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. \\nThe\\xa0Management has reviewed such accounting \\ntreatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in \\nterms of the relevant Ind AS.\\n(K) Leases\\n  The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to \\nbe a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. \\nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement. \\nThe Group uses judgement in assessing whether a \\ncontract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease \\nterm (including anticipated renewals), the applicable \\ndiscount rate, variable lease payments whether \\nare in-substance fixed. The judgement involves \\nassessment of whether the asset included in the \\ncontract is a fully or partly identified asset based on \\nthe facts and circumstances, whether the contract \\ninclude a lease and non-lease component and if so, \\nseparation thereof for the purpose of recognition and \\nmeasurement, determination of lease term basis, inter \\nalia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether \\nthe lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use \\nof the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the \\nlease payments are fixed are variable or a combination \\nof both.D. Standards Issued but not Effective\\n  On March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs \\n(MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting \\nStandards) Amendment Rules, 2023.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the \\nterms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined \\nin the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI \\nof $\\xa0165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional \\nProfit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023. \\nThe next date of hearing is awaited.\\n   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified \\nthe New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to \\ninstruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under \\nthe guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be \\ncredited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool \\nAccount is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 35.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ \\n1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on behalf \\nof all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The \\nArbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an appeal on 15th \\nNovember, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award \\nof the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration \\nAward dated 24th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI’s appeal.\\n  (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) \\nagainst GOI on 16th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts (‘PSCs’) for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks \\ndue to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by \\nmajority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, \\n2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on \\n16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral \\nTribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1st October, 2018 (‘2018 \\nFPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English \\nCommercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and \\nremitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable \\naward on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements \\nCase Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application \\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral \\nTribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which \\nwill take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. \\n    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and \\nexecution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The \\nClaimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition \\nbefore the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon'ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking \\nenforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) \\nrelating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\\n  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a \\nperiod of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses \\nin the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\\n   Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations. \\nMoreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\\n(C in crore)\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\n36.

Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) of SEBI in respect of the \\nSCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity \\nderivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the \\ndate of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from \\nNovember 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities \\nAppellate Tribunal (“SAT”) against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 \\nand directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other \\nnoticees has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble \\nSupreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of \\nthe appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order \\ndated December 17, 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. In the very same matter, on November 21, 2017, SEBI \\nissued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI \\n(Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed \\nunder the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The Adjudicating Officer of SEBI passed an \\norder on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL. RIL has paid the penalty under protest and has filed an \\nappeal before the SAT against this order.\\n (IV)  Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of \\nTelecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to C 3,748 crore which includes penalty \\nand interest thereon (Previous Year C 3,620 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations \\nto DOT contesting the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good \\ngrounds on merit to defend itself in the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in \\nrespect of the aforesaid matter.37. Capital Management\\n  The Group adheres to a disciplined Capital Management framework in order to maintain a strong balance sheet. The main \\nobjectives are as follows:\\n a)  Maintain investment grade ratings for all issuing entities, domestically and internationally by ensuring that the financial \\nstrength of their Balance Sheets are preserved.\\n b)  Manage foreign exchange, interest rates and commodity price risk, and minimise the impact of market volatility on earnings. \\n c)  Diversify sources of financing and spread the maturity across tenure buckets in order to manage liquidity risk.\\n d) Leverage optimally in order to maximise shareholder returns.\\n The Net Gearing Ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\\n(C in crore)\\nParticularsAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\nGross Debt 3,13,966 2,66,305\\nCash and Marketable Securities * 1,88,200 2,31,490\\nNet Debt (A) 1,25,766 34,815\\nTotal Equity (As per Balance Sheet) (B) 7,15,872 7,79,485\\nNet Gearing Ratio (A/B) 0.18 0.04\\n  *  Cash and Marketable Securities include Cash and Cash Equivalents of C 68,664 crore (Previous Year C 36,178 crore), Current Investments of  \\nC 118,473 crore (Previous Year C 1,08,118 crore), Other Marketable Securities of C 1,022 crore (Previous Year C 87,113 crore including investments \\nin Jio Digital Fibre Private Limited and Summit Digitel Infrastructure Limited) and Share Call money receivable on rights issue of  \\nC\\xa041 crore (Previous Year C 81 crore).\\n38.

B. Financial Risk Management\\n   The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within \\nthe boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the \\nvolatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance. \\n  i) Market Risk\\n    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes \\nin market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are \\ndenominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial \\ninstruments at the end of the reporting period.

The \\nGroup has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity \\nprices and freight costs.\\n    The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control \\nprocesses. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives \\nand uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and \\nfreight exposure.\\n  iii) Credit Risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and \\nreceivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to \\ncustomers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \\nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \\nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \\nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv) Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \\nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure \\nefficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the \\nGroup’s cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including \\ncontingencies.\\n    The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. \\nTreasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net \\ndeficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank \\ndeposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to \\navoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars*Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@13,449 8,594 27,254 78,290 42,750 62,688 2,33,025\\nCurrent ^77,761 3,500 1,316 - - - 82,577\\nTotal 91,210 12,094 28,570 78,290 42,750 62,688 3,15,602\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 1,491 1,495 2,877 8,820 6,327 15,153 36,163\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 2,658 3,102 405 71 4 - 6,240\\nOptions 106 20 63 35 - - 224\\nInterest Rate Swaps 3 13 44 97 139 3 299\\nTotal 2,767 3,135 512 203 143 3 6,763\\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,47,172 crore.\\n# Includes C 1,190 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 127 crore as revaluation gain.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n^ Includes C 319 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.(C in crore)\\nParticulars*Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022*\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current # @2,266 6,715 18,207 81,494 44,682 62,456 2,15,820\\nCurrent ^39,736 11,228 1,214 - - - 52,178\\nTotal 42,002 17,943 19,421 81,494 44,682 62,456 2,67,998\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 965 954 1,880 6,765 5,475 6,315 22,354\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 4,740 1,805 1,001 683 - - 8,229\\nOptions 151 2 20 - - - 173\\nInterest Rate Swaps - - 4 598 70 - 672\\nTotal 4,891 1,807 1,025 1,281 70 - 9,074\\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,59,330 crore.\\n# Includes C 1,053 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 48 crore as revaluation gain.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n^ Includes C 592 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n C. Hedge Accounting\\n   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and \\nother feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group \\nhas adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved \\nhedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange \\ntraded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve \\nthis objective. \\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a \\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative \\nmethod and critical term matching method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n486 487\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Ambani  \\nChairman and Managing Director,\\nReliance Industries\\nFrom the very inception, we at \\nReliance have believed that a \\ncorporate is much more than an \\neconomic unit generating wealth. It is \\nan integral part of the social system \\ncatering to human and societal \\nneeds and aspirations. The painful \\nperiod of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nbrought out Reliance’s spirit of \\nsocietal service like never before. The \\nway the whole Reliance Family worked \\nwith a sense of national duty in this \\nperiod was most satisfying to me, and \\nI am sure, to all of you as well.\\nWe were able to quickly change \\nand repurpose our processes, our \\npolicies, our roles and responsibilities, \\nour plants, our systems with a single \\nmotive – to support others. If the \\nproduction teams worked over \\nproducing PPE kits or medical-grade \\noxygen, the Jio and Retail teams \\ntook care that no customer was left \\nwithout daily essentials or internet services. The IT teams ensured \\nemployees could work remotely, and \\nthe HR teams ensured the employees \\nreceived the best possible social \\nsecurity. Our Foundation hospitals \\nand internal medical teams ensured \\nall employees and their families \\nreceived timely medical help \\nregardless of location, while creating \\nthe largest COVID infrastructure pan-\\nIndia in the shortest possible time. \\nThe Foundation teams took up the \\nmammoth responsibility of reaching \\nout to the most disadvantaged, \\nmarginalised communities to ensure \\nnobody went hungry.\\nEach and every Reliance Family \\nmember directly or indirectly \\nparticipated in the fight against \\nCOVID. Each and every Reliance \\nFamily member went beyond their \\ncall of duty. Each and every Reliance \\nFamily member became the Brand \\nAmbassador of Reliance’s spirit of Care and Empathy. It is heartening to \\nsee that together we have overcome \\nthe worst. It is with great hope that I \\nlook forward to the future of Reliance, \\nof India, as well as the entire world.\\nTaking volatility in stride\\nJust when we were about to heave \\na sigh of relief, the rise in geopolitical \\ntensions have exposed the fault lines \\nin the global economy. Geopolitical \\nconflict has caused significant \\ndislocation in energy markets and \\ndisrupted traditional trade flows. \\nThe process of globalisation, which \\ndrove the global economic growth \\nover the last four decades, appears \\nto have hit a wall. The cause of \\neconomic inter-dependence that \\nglobalisation promoted to help \\nalign every country’s interests and, \\nthereby, help reduce conflicts, has \\ntaken a back seat.Dear and Esteemed Fellow Shareholders,Reliance played a leading \\nrole in caring for India and \\nIndians in the last couple \\nof years of the pandemic. \\nWe now aim to care for \\nthe Planet as we embark \\non our most exciting \\ntransformation – the Green \\nTransformation.Growing Stronger to Care Better\\nFortunately, Reliance is better \\nequipped to face these uncertainties \\ntoday than ever before. Reliance \\nhas built three extremely agile and \\nhighly potent growth engines – Digital \\nServices, Retail and O2C – which \\nwere all tested, and came out with \\nflying colours, during the COVID-led \\nextreme volatility. It is just last year \\nthat Reliance deleveraged its balance \\nsheet to a net debt zero status. \\nBesides, India’s own strong growth \\nprospects over the next couple of \\ndecades bodes well for Reliance.\\nReliance has maintained its \\nleadership position among Indian \\ncorporates for nearly three decades \\nnow. It is Reliance’s ability to innovate, \\nto build in unparalleled flexibility, to \\ntransform itself from time to time \\nand the great conviction in India’s \\ncapability to compete globally \\nat world-scale, which has helped \\nthe Company stay at the top and \\ncontinue making newer records.\\nGreen transformation  \\nbegins\\nGetting bigger and stronger only \\nmeans Reliance is ready to take \\nup even greater responsibilities \\nto serve not just the surrounding \\ncommunities or India, but also the \\nwhole planet. Reliance has made a \\nfirm commitment to become one of \\nthe world’s leaders in the fight against \\nthe crisis of climate change.\\nFY 2021-22 marked the beginning of \\nReliance’s Green Transformation, at a \\nscale which will make India the world’s \\nleading green energy producer. We \\nknow that affordability is the most \\ncritical factor in the adoption of any \\nnew technology and the scale of \\nsocietal benefit it can create. Reliance \\nhas embarked on this journey with a \\nvision to repeat the feat it achieved \\nin wireless broadband. In the field of \\nGreen Energy – Reliance will develop \\nend-to-end Green Energy solutions, \\nwhich will make clean and abundant energy available to everyone at the \\nmost affordable price. Just as India \\nhas the world’s most affordable \\nwireless broadband today, we will \\nhave the world’s most affordable \\nGreen Energy within this decade. And \\nthese solutions will then be exported \\nto other countries, helping them \\ncontain carbon emissions.\\nLeveraging its world-class execution \\ncapability and the strong debt-\\nfree balance sheet, Reliance \\nhas committed to improving the \\neconomics of this Green ecosystem \\nto directly compete with the fossil \\nfuels. However, one cannot operate \\nin just one segment of the Green \\nEnergy value chain and hope the \\ncost-efficient ecosystem will come up \\non its own. Reliance has undertaken \\nto enable the entire Green Energy \\necosystem throughout India starting \\nwith solar power generation, to \\nproduction of green hydrogen to its \\ndistribution and consumption.\\nGreen Energy is a rapidly evolving \\nvast global industry with a lot of \\ntechnological innovation under \\nway. To guide on this path, we \\nestablished the Reliance New Energy \\nCouncil with some of the globally \\nrenowned thought leaders in the \\nfield. To kickstart the initiative, last \\nyear Reliance announced a $10 billion \\ncapex commitment over three years.\\nWe entered into a series of \\npartnerships, including equity \\ninvestments, with local and \\ninternational corporates with \\nunique technological and execution \\ncapabilities, with a strong track record \\nof innovation and a growing number \\nof patents and IPRs across the Green \\nEnergy value chain.\\nReliance’s partnerships include \\ncompanies like Ambri in the \\nUS, Faradion in the UK and The \\nNetherlands-based Lithium Werks in \\nthe energy storage space.\\nSimilarly, Reliance invested in \\nGermany’s NexWafe, which is a pioneer in next-gen technology to \\nproduce monocrystalline silicon \\nwafers needed in making solar \\npanels. We also acquired promoters’ \\nstake in REC Solar – a global \\ntechnology leader in solar panel \\nmanufacturing. Reliance picked \\nup a 40% stake in Sterling & Wilson \\nRenewable Energy – one of the world’s \\nleading EPC turnkey contractors in \\nlarge scale solar projects.\\nIn the Hydrogen ecosystem, Reliance \\njoined hands with the US-based Chart \\nIndustries to set up India H2\\xa0Alliance \\nto commercialise hydrogen \\ntechnology and develop a supply \\nchain in collaboration with other \\nIndian stakeholders. We also entered \\ninto an agreement with Denmark’s \\nStiesdal A/S for its innovative next-gen \\nelectrolyser technology, which has \\nthe potential to reduce dramatically \\nthe cost of producing hydrogen \\nfrom pure water.\\nSimultaneously, we began work on \\nthe four Giga-factories at Dhirubhai \\nAmbani Green Energy Giga Complex \\nto set up world-scale production \\ncapacity for solar panels, energy \\nstorage systems, electrolysers and \\nfuel cells spread over 5,000 acres in \\nJamnagar. Reliance will also invest in \\ncreating an ecosystem of thousands \\nof small and medium scale \\nproject consultants and installers \\npan-India to set up Green Energy \\ngeneration projects in every nook \\nand corner of the country. Similarly, \\nReliance will undertake large Giga \\nWatt scale turnkey Green Energy \\nprojects for Power GenCos or large \\ninvestors on its own.\\nWith these collaborations and \\nthe Giga-factories, Reliance is set \\nto achieve a uniquely integrated \\nposition in the Green Energy value \\nchain globally. This deep integration, \\napart from the new-age technologies \\nand world-class execution \\ncapabilities, will ensure Reliance’s \\nrenewable energy systems stay at \\nthe cutting edge of cost efficiency \\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Jio has the largest \\nsingle-country subscriber base and \\ncarries the highest volume of data \\ntraffic globally, excluding China.\\nIn line with the industry, Jio raised \\ntariffs by ~20% across all prepaid \\nplans effective December 2021, while \\nensuring that Jio continues to provide \\nthe best value for money to all \\nconsumers across every price point.\\nThe year also saw Jio emerge as \\nthe leader in fiber based wireline \\nbroadband connectivity with over 5 \\nmillion connected homes.

During FY 2021-22, \\nthe Company’s capex increased in \\nall businesses, due to which the year \\nclosed with marginal net debt.\\nThe Company continues to manage \\nits treasury operations actively \\nand efficiently to reduce interest \\nburden and lengthen maturities. \\nAt the very beginning of FY 2021-22, \\nReliance Industries made history \\nby raising a jumbo loan of $4 billion \\non better terms than any corporate \\nin the Asian region with similar \\ncredit profile. It was the largest-ever \\nforeign currency bond issuance from \\nIndia, with the lowest coupon rate \\nachieved for benchmark 30-year \\nand 40-year issuances by a private \\nsector BBB corporate from Asia ex-\\nJapan. Similarly, the Company paid \\n`30,791 crore to the Government of \\nIndia towards its 15 years of future \\nspectrum dues to save on annual \\ninterest cost burden.\\nExecuting our growth plans\\nReliance’s diversified portfolio of \\nbusiness verticals represent our \\ngrowth engines, where we have been \\nadding capabilities consistently. \\nDuring FY 2021-22, each one of these \\ngrowth engines moved into top gear, \\ncementing Reliance’s position further \\nas India’s largest company by sales, \\nprofits as well as market value.globally.

With \\nReliance switching to green and \\nrenewable energy for its energy \\nneeds, syngas will become available \\nfor upgradation to high value \\npetrochemicals and hydrogen fuel. \\nThe highly concentrated stream of \\nCO2 in syngas can be easily captured \\nand sequestered. All these steps will \\ngreatly reduce the carbon footprint of \\nthe Jamnagar complex.\\nFinancial and operational \\nperformance FY 2021-22\\nLet me now elaborate on Reliance’s \\noperating and financial performance \\nduring FY 2021-22.\\nDuring the year, Reliance was able \\nto overcome all the pandemic-led \\ndifficulties to post another record \\nperformance operationally as well as \\nfinancially with strong contribution \\nfrom all our businesses.

The \\nprogress of telecom technology \\nis making inefficient 2G obsolete. \\nThe Jio revolution since 2016 has \\nalready lowered the 4G tariffs below \\nthe 2G tariffs in India. However, \\nhandset affordability has proven \\na major hurdle for over 250 million \\nIndians, preventing a transition to \\ndigital networks.\\nTo overcome this hurdle, Jio \\nlaunched JioPhone Next – world’s \\nmost affordable full-touchscreen \\n4G phone – in collaboration with \\nGoogle. The phone runs on Pragati \\nOS – a specially optimised version of \\nGoogle’s Android OS.\\nThe technology in the Internet, \\nCommunication and Telecom (ICT) \\nindustry continues to make rapid \\nstrides globally and India is getting \\nready to join the 5G bandwagon. \\nJio also took major steps in getting \\nready for 5G, with its 100% indigenous \\ntechnology. Jio successfully carried \\nout 5G testing across sites and has \\ncompleted 5G coverage planning \\nacross 1,000 Indian cities. Jio has \\nalso developed several use cases for \\n5G in industries like healthcare and \\nindustrial automation.\\nJio entered into a strategic \\npartnership with Google for its Cloud \\nSolutions to power the 5G experience \\nof Indian enterprises as well as \\nconsumers. Jio also joined hands \\nwith University of Oulu in Finland – the \\nleader of the world’s first major 6G \\nresearch programme – to accelerate \\nresearch and standardisation in \\n6G – the futuristic next generation of \\ntelecom technology after 5G.Oil to Chemicals\\nPG 98\\nThe rapid growth in vaccinations and \\nreopening of economies helped a \\nstrong economic recovery globally \\nin FY 2021-22.

This \\nkicked off the rebranding process for \\nall 1,460 fuel outlets the JV operates \\nin India with a view to provide an \\nunmatched and distinctive customer \\nexperience. These Mobility Stations \\nbring together a range of services for \\nconsumers on the move – including \\nadditivised fuels, EV charging, \\nrefreshments & food, and plan to offer \\nmore low carbon solutions over time.\\nWith a vision of being the leading \\nEV charging infrastructure player \\nin India, Jio-bp constructed and \\nlaunched couple of country's largest \\nEV charging hubs in Delhi NCR with \\nBluSmart as its primary customer.\\nReliance’s world-class O2C assets \\nand very high level of backward \\nintegration will continue to maximise \\noutput and returns, and continue \\nto transition towards a sustainable, \\ncarbon-neutral, circular economy \\nbusiness in the coming years.\\nOil and Gas E&P\\nPG 122\\nFY 2021-22 was a milestone year \\nfor our Oil & Gas business, with \\ntwo of the three phases of KG-D6 \\ndevelopment project commissioning. \\nNotwithstanding the difficulties \\ncaused by the COVID pandemic, \\nReliance and bp were able to \\ncomplete the work on Satellite \\nCluster and R-Cluster fields to \\nstart production and scale up \\nduring the year.With both these fields commissioning, \\nKG-D6 is now producing 18 MMSCMD \\nof natural gas, accounting for ~20% of \\nIndia's gas production.\\nThe business posted significantly \\nimproved financial performance, \\nthanks to a recovery in domestic \\npricing of natural gas.\\nThe third phase of KG-D6 project \\nis progressing as per plan. The \\ndevelopment of MJ field is nearing \\ncompletion of drilling activity, as \\nwell as the offshore installations. The \\nproject is expected to commission \\nby end 2022 and take our total \\nproduction to 30 MMSCMD.\\nIn line with our strategic intentions, \\nReliance exited all its remaining \\ninvestments in US shale gas this year.\\nCorporate Social \\nResponsibility and \\nSustainability\\nReliance has always believed in \\ndoing well by doing good. It is our firm \\nbelief that the long-term success of a \\ncorporate depends on giving back to \\nthe society it operates in and ensuring \\nits operations are sustainable. \\nDuring FY 2021-22, Reliance Industries \\ncontinued to remain India Inc.'s \\nlargest spender on Corporate Social \\nResponsibility.The breadth and depth of work \\nReliance Foundation carried out in \\nIndia’s fight against COVID was simply \\nastonishing. It set a new benchmark in \\nwhat a corporate foundation can do \\nand achieve, if it is determined and \\nfocused. Reliance Foundation created \\nmassive COVID-care infrastructure \\npan-India, treating lakhs of patients. It \\nsupplied free-of-cost medical oxygen \\nto over 1 lakh critical patients a day, \\nprovided lakhs of PPE kits free-of-\\ncost to frontline workers, distributed \\n8.5+ crore free meals through \\n'Anna Seva' to the needy, 40+ lakh \\nvaccinations provided free of cost by \\nReliance to support the nation in its \\nvaccination mission.\\nAll the while, Reliance Foundation’s \\nwork in the fields of Rural \\nEmpowerment, Sports for Youth, \\nEducation, Disaster Management \\namong others continued \\nto progress well.\\nConclusion\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic struck at a \\ntime when the world was entering \\na great phase of transformation. \\nNow that the pandemic is nearly \\nover, geopolitical tensions in several \\nparts of the world have come to a \\nboil. All this has resulted in significant \\nvolatility, high inflationary pressure \\nand uncertainty in the energy \\nand commodity markets. Crude \\noil prices, which had dipped into \\nnegative territory at the start of 2020, \\njumped to a 14-year peak of $130 at \\nthe start of 2022.\\nReliance is built to weather such \\nstorms. Firstly, it is well diversified \\nacross Digital Services, Retail \\nand Energy & Materials business. \\nSecondly, over the years it has \\nbuilt in unparalleled level of agility \\nin each of its business verticals. \\nThirdly, its global scale of operations \\nhelp in overcoming many hurdles. \\nAnd lastly, the Company’s balance \\nsheet has expanded, but is \\nextremely light on debt.In its true ethos of Care and Empathy, \\nReliance has charted its next journey \\nof transformation to help the world \\ncope with the climate change \\ncrisis. Over the next 12 months our \\ninvestments across the Green Energy \\nvalue chain will gradually start going \\nlive, scaling up over the next couple \\nof years. This new growth engine \\nholds great promise to outshine \\nall our existing growth engines in \\njust 5-7 years.\\nAt the same time, Reliance continues \\nto expand its existing businesses \\nto newer frontiers of technology, \\ninnovation, scale and execution. \\nJio has already created the most \\nreliable connectivity infrastructure \\nthroughout India, and is ready with an \\narray of value-added digital services \\nand products. Today Reliance Retail \\nhas the deepest grassroots level \\npan-India supply chain capability, \\nthe broadest supplier base, and a \\nnetwork of kirana partners to provide excellent service to end consumers. \\nReliance’s O2C business is a global \\nleader in terms of level of integration \\n– a business model innovation that is \\nbeing emulated globally.\\nAll of Reliance’s capabilities are \\ncreated to serve India, to enable \\nIndians. I am sure India will emerge \\nstronger out of the current volatility, \\njust the way it did through the \\nlast couple of years. India is set \\nto become one of the world’s top \\nthree economies in the next couple \\nof decades, and all of Reliance’s \\nbusiness verticals will play a \\nleading role in achieving that. India \\nand Reliance will aim to play a \\nleading role in the world’s transition \\nto Clean Energy.\\nThe last two years were the most \\ndifficult for everyone in living \\nmemory. I have great admiration \\nand appreciation for the scientists, \\ndoctors, nurses, and all frontline workers who risked their lives, \\nour teams at O2C, Jio, Retail and \\nFoundation, who helped not just the \\nCompany, but also the society whom \\nwe serve, navigate the difficult times.\\nI would also like to place on record my \\nsincere appreciation to the Board of \\nDirectors for their guidance.

This is the strongest pace \\namong major economies. The \\neconomic expansion has been \\nsupported by a strong national \\nvaccination drive that enabled \\neasing of COVID-19 related \\nrestrictions. India administered more \\nthan 177 crore doses of vaccine \\nduring the financial year, thereby \\nfully vaccinating more than 60% of \\nits population. \\nThe economic impact of the Omicron \\nCOVID-19 variant was relatively mild \\nwith most high-frequency indicators \\nabove pre-pandemic level.

Reliance \\nTreasury continued to stay focused on \\nproviding liquidity to the businesses \\nat the optimal risk adjusted cost by \\naccessing financing from different \\nmarkets and using appropriate \\ninstruments and currencies. \\nTreasury Management and \\nFinancial Strategy\\nReliance Treasury’s impeccable timing \\non executing landmark transactions \\nnot just from India but also from Asia \\ncan be attributed to its ability and \\nforesight to see emerging trends in \\nfinancial markets. \\nReliance Treasury continuously \\nmonitors the financial markets to \\nassess financing and investment \\nopportunities to raise financing at \\noptimised cost and deliver superior \\nreturns respectively. It identifies \\nopportunities to reduce interest \\ncosts and extend maturity profile \\nof its existing debt portfolio. It also \\nmaintains a prudent mix of funding \\nsources across instrument classes, \\nfinancing products, geographies and \\ninvestor classes.\\nFund Raising\\nReliance continues to be a \\nsophisticated and innovative issuer \\nof securities across the capital \\nstructure. During the year, Reliance \\nissued US$ 4 billion senior unsecured \\nnotes across 10-years, 30-years and \\n40-years tranches comprising (i) US$ \\n1,500,000,000 2.875% Senior Unsecured \\nNotes due 2032, (ii) US$ 1,750,000,000 \\n3.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due \\n2052 and (iii) US$ 750,000,000 3.750% \\nSenior Unsecured Notes due 2062. The \\nNotes were nearly 3x oversubscribed \\nwith a peak order book aggregating \\n~US$ 11.5 billion and were priced financial year. The monetary policy \\npriority among advanced economies \\nis now decisively centered around \\npreserving consumer purchasing \\npower and to anchor inflationary \\nexpectations amidst multi-decade \\nhigh inflation. The withdrawal of ultra-\\naccommodation both on the interest \\nrates and liquidity front is primarily \\nled by US Fed and has gained traction \\nin other developed economies \\nincluding Emerging Markets. The \\noutlook of sharp upward adjustment \\nin global interest rates and calibrated \\nwithdrawal of liquidity is leading to \\ntighter financial conditions. \\nOn the domestic front, the \\nreverberation of change in global \\nmonetary landscape and rising \\ninflationary pressure has tilted \\nthe balance in favour of gradual \\nwithdrawal of policy accommodation. \\nThe RBI has signalled this shift \\nin policy priority by pushing the \\ncost of domestic liquidity through \\nnarrowing of LAF corridor, unlimited \\nsterilisation through new instrument \\nof Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) \\nand change in monetary policy \\nstance (MPC) to focus on withdrawal \\nof accommodation. The average \\ninflation trajectory during FY 2022-23  \\nis likely to stay closer to the higher \\nend of RBI-MPC target of 6% whereas \\nthe growth impulses may moderate \\nfurther. On the external front, the \\ndeterioration in current account \\ndeficit (CAD) to 2.5% of GDP and \\nuncertainty on capital inflows amidst \\ntightening global financial conditions \\nis likely to exert depreciation pressure \\non the rupee in the near term. Overall, \\nthe macroeconomic outlook of \\nchallenging growth inflation trade-\\noff, faster policy normalisation \\nin developed economies and \\ngeopolitical issues may keep the \\nvolatility high in the domestic \\nfinancial markets.\\nFinancial markets were extremely \\nchoppy and volatile during the year. \\nThe first half of the year saw stable \\nexchange rate and interest rates \\nin the market. However the second \\nhalf of the year witnessed rupee \\ndepreciation and a gradual move through the Company’s secondary \\ncurve. Reliance has now joined a select \\ngroup of issuers from Asia to have \\nmade jumbo foreign currency bond \\nissuances. The proceeds from the notes \\nwere primarily used for refinancing \\nexisting borrowings.\\nThis transaction was significant on \\nvarious counts:\\n• It was the largest ever foreign \\ncurrency bond issuance from India \\n• It had the tightest ever implied \\ncredit spread over the respective \\nUS Treasury across each of the 3 \\ntranches by an Indian Corporate\\n• It carried the lowest coupon \\nachieved for benchmark 30-year \\nand 40-year issuances by a private \\nsector BBB corporate from Asia ex-\\nJapan \\n• It had a first ever 40-year tranche \\noffering by a BBB private sector \\ncorporate from Asia ex Japan \\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Reliance \\nJio Infocomm Limited prepaid entire \\ndeferred liabilities pertaining to \\nspectrum acquired in auctions of \\nyear 2014, 2015, 2016 and the spectrum \\nacquired in FY 2021-22 through trading \\nof right to use with Bharti Airtel Limited \\naggregating to `30,791 crore (including \\naccrued interest).

The 4G subscriber \\nbase across the industry is now over \\n730 million as of March 2022, thanks \\nto increasing broadband network \\npenetration across both urban and \\nrural India and the improving device \\necosystem. More than 250 million 2G \\nfeature phone users in the country \\nwill also be transitioning to digital \\nnetworks over the next few years. \\nThe pandemic’s impact on recharge \\ncycle and tariff hike have caused a \\ntransient SIM consolidation, mainly \\nfor low usage and inconsistent \\nsubscriber base. This has rationalised \\nthe reported subscriber base and \\nshould bring cost and network \\nefficiencies for the industry.\\nIncreasing smartphones \\nand new use cases boost \\ndata traffic\\nImproving smartphone penetration \\nand increasing proliferation of digital \\napplications have resulted in a 38% \\nincrease in data usage across the \\ncountry over CY 2021 (~137 Exabytes \\nof data usage in India during 2021). \\nAccording to the Ericsson Mobility \\nReport 2021, total mobile data traffic \\nin India is projected to increase \\nby more than 4x to reach 49.0 \\nExabytes per month by 2027. This will \\nbe driven by two factors – greater \\nsmartphone penetration, including in \\nrural areas, and increase in average \\ndata usage per smartphone. Jio’s \\ndevice strategy and sustained \\ninvestments in digital will be key to this \\nenhanced data usage.5G rollout\\n Earlier in the year, the Department of \\nTelecommunications (DoT) allotted \\ntrial spectrum for 5G services to all \\noperators. 5G field trials are currently \\nunderway, with all operators working \\nwith their respective network vendors \\nto test the network and develop \\nrelevant use cases. DoT and Telecom \\nRegulatory Authority of India (TRAI) are \\nworking towards conducting auction \\nfor 5G spectrum bands in 2022.\\nIncreasing need for good \\nquality FTTX\\nIndia’s leapfrog into mobility \\nbroadband has resulted in the \\nfixed broadband sector being an \\nunder-invested space for the past \\ntwo decades. As a result, India has \\namongst the lowest fixed broadband \\npenetration in the world at less than \\n10% households. Fiber penetration is even lower, with \\nmost fixed broadband running on \\nlegacy copper-based infrastructure. \\nCOVID-19 lockdowns and the \\nconsequent need to work-from-\\nhome and learn-from-home, have \\nreinforced the need for high quality \\nfixed broadband.\\nPositive changes in the \\nIndian telecom landscape\\nIn September 2021, the Government of \\nIndia undertook decisive steps in the \\nform of reforms and a relief package \\nto strengthen the Indian telecom \\nsector.

Therefore, the transition \\nfrom old energy to new, green and clean energy is inevitable and will trigger major geopolitical shifts, economic \\ntransformations and redefine financial models in the 21st century. \\nThe accelerated pace of transition to a lower-carbon world will be accompanied by far-reaching changes in \\nregulations, governance norms, market conditions and technology. Societal sentiments against harmful environmental \\npractices are growing. Regulations mandating the minimum use of renewable energy for operations and incentivising \\nthe use of alternate energy sources coupled with technological advances and changing customer preferences have \\nthe potential to lower demand for fossil fuels and their price, increase RIL's operational costs and prevent access to \\nstrategically important markets and new energy reserves.\\nClimate change related disruptions, including rising temperatures and sea levels, heat waves, erratic rainfall, floods and \\ndroughts can adversely impact the smooth functioning of RIL's supply chain. \\nFinancial institutions and investors are nudging the world's transition to a low-carbon economy and limiting their \\nexposure to particular industries or projects. These developments could affect access to capital markets for Reliance \\nand its partners. The rising sentiment against fossil fuels could impact shareholder opinions and cause fluctuations in \\nRIL's valuation. RIL could be impacted by growing litigation and activism, necessitating increased environmental and \\nlegal liability provisions. Trade regimes and tariff caps could further impact the Company's financial flows. Measures \\nto make organisations accountable for their GHG emissions may increase compliance costs arising from technology \\ninvestments needed for monitoring, mitigation and sequestering. \\nRisk Response\\nAddressing climate change through \\nenergy transition is a strategic focus \\nof RIL's business continuity plans. \\nWe believe if Old Energy created \\nthe problem of Climate Change, \\nNew Energy is poised to provide a \\nreliable solution to Climate Mitigation. \\nReliance has announced a Net \\nCarbon Zero target for 2035, going \\nbeyond compliance requirements \\nand business imperatives. We aim to \\ninvest `75,000 crore by 2024 to: • Enable at least 100 GW of solar \\nenergy by 2030 \\n• Build four Giga factories to build an \\nintegrated, end-to-end renewable \\nenergy ecosystem \\n• Invest in enhancing the value \\nchain, partnerships and future \\ntechnologies, including upstream \\nand downstream industries \\n• Transform RIL's business to Net \\nCarbon Zero operations We have a 15-year vision to rebuild \\nReliance as one of the world's leading \\nNew Energy and New Materials \\nCompany. The roadmap includes \\ncreating sustainable energy sources \\nand materials for India's future needs, \\nbuilding world-scale assets that \\nproduce clean fuels and materials \\nof the future and developing next-\\ngeneration Carbon Capture and \\nStorage technologies to convert \\ncarbon dioxide into useful products \\nand chemicals. The Company is prone to the following categories of risk:\\nStrategic and  \\nCommercial RisksSafety and \\nOperational RisksCompliance and \\nControl RisksFinancial \\nRisks\\nPG 134 PG 139 PG 141 PG 142We are developing the Dhirubhai \\nAmbani Green Energy Giga Complex \\non 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, \\ncomprising four Giga Factories. \\nThese include an integrated solar \\nphotovoltaic module factory, an \\nadvanced energy storage battery \\nfactory for intermittent energy, an \\nElectrolyser Factory for the production \\nof Green Hydrogen and a Fuel Cell \\nFactory for converting hydrogen into \\nmotive and stationary power.

This, coupled with commissioning of additional refining capacity \\nnotwithstanding the refinery closures in the West due to poor economics and in China due to pollution, keeps refining \\nmargins under pressure.\\nThe crude oil market remains tight due to production from OPEC Plus countries falling short of their targets and \\ncontinued sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Crude oil stocks have fallen close to 5-year lows. Besides, geopolitical \\ndevelopments like Russia and US/EU standoff on Ukraine and Houthi drone attacks in the UAE have added to the \\nprice volatility as well as causing a high-risk premium on crude oil. Alongside the above, gas prices also rose sharply \\nincreasing input costs.\\nImpact of unforeseen events like pandemic on product evacuation, challenges in logistics and thereby probable \\nrisk of stock surplus, plant shutdowns and stringent recycling norms and government regulations can reduce \\nplastic consumption.\\nReliance Retail operates in the consumer sector and a slowdown in macro-economic growth and weak consumer \\nsentiments/spending could have a bearing on its performance. Government restrictions on account of the COVID-19 \\npandemic could affect smooth operation of business activities, store operation, and expansion. Sporadic disruptions in \\nthe operating environment and inability to build infrastructure at a pace and scale needed by the rapidly growing Retail \\nbusiness could hinder operational efficiency and customer service. \\nCompetitive pressure from the retail industry reflected in price wars between various retailers and resulted in traditional \\nretailers moving from the physical retail world into e-commerce platforms disrupting walk-ins.\\nRisk Response\\nProactive measures by Reliance \\nsuch as revised product placement \\nstrategies, placement in deficit \\nmarket through exports to diverse \\ngeographical locations mitigated \\nthe risk of non-evacuation with \\nminimal adverse effect.

While Reliance continues to \\nfocus on large scale digitisation, it brings a lot of concerns around Cyber Security with the use of new technologies, \\nopen source software, adoption of cloud, etc. Consequently, cyber-attack surfaces also increase substantially which \\nincreases the cyber security risks.\\nDigital services being technology driven, there is an inherent risk of errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in products \\nand internal systems.Safety and Operational Risks\\nHealth, Safety and Environmental ( HSE ) Risks in Operations\\nRisk Description\\nHSE risks include the effects of natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, among others) and safety lapses on human \\ncapital. The nature of its operations exposes the Company, its employees and the society, to a wide range of health, \\nsafety, security and environment risks due to the geographical location and technical complexity of operations. \\nVarious HSE regulations across geographies regulate Reliance’s business of Exploration & Production of oil and gas, and \\ntheir further refining and downstream processing. A major HSE incident, such as fire, oil spill and security breach, can \\nresult in loss of life, environmental degradation and overall disruption in business activities.\\nHSE risk in retail extends to food safety and waste management also. The nature of retail operations exposes RIL's \\nemployees and contractors to a wide range of occupational health hazards as well as safety risks due to complexity \\nof operational requirements. Changes in HSE regulatory framework possibly will have lasting effect on Retail Business, \\nespecially in the environmental domain like changes in plastic waste management and e-waste rules. \\nRisk Response\\nDuring the year, RIL's facilities in \\nthe hydrocarbon business have \\ncontinued focused efforts to \\nmanage the risks for safe, reliable, \\nand compliant operations. Safety \\nand operational risk management \\nframework continues to play a pivotal \\nrole in consistently managing HSE \\nrisks on a real-time basis.\\nReliance entities have devised novel \\nways to review and audit the facilities \\nperiodically through virtual and \\nphysical means. Reliance has been \\nactive in networking with industry and \\nsponsored and participated in the ‘6th \\nGlobal Summit on Process Safety by \\nCentre for Chemical Process Safety’ \\nand continued its contribution in developing safe industry practices \\nthrough participation in Standards \\nCommittees of statutory authorities \\n(OISD, PNGRB, etc.)\\nReliance’s digital safety platform \\nproject has progressed well in \\ndigitalising its key HSE processes \\nthrough Industry 4.0 technologies. \\nThis year, Reliance rolled out solutions \\nfor digitalising risk registers, three \\nlines of defense program across its \\nkey hydrocarbon entities. Reliance \\nhas undertaken significant activities \\non new projects in hydrocarbon \\nbusiness, in its fuel retail business \\nand New Energy domain, which have \\nprogressed through various phases. Reliance has taken various measures \\nto protect health of its workforce \\nin the pandemic.\\nThe Retail business poses risks \\ninherent to retail operations involving \\nfire, breakdown in work event and risk \\nrelated to ergonomics. Every member \\nof the workforce is communicated \\non the potential exposure to HSE \\nrisks, and they are an integral part of \\nrisk management. For the Grocery \\nbusiness, food safety checks have \\nbeen implemented to provide \\nmultiple layers of assurance, thereby \\nensuring the safety of consumers.\\nSafety and Environmental Risks During Transportation\\nRisk Description\\nWith most of the crude being supplied to RIL by sea vessels, and the overwhelming majority of refined products being \\nexported by sea, road and pipeline, the Company faces the risk of HSE incidents, oil spills and so on, leading to disruption \\nin business activities.\\nEvents like technical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather, human error and other adverse events or \\nconditions could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, as well as fires, explosions or \\nother personal and process safety incidents.\\nRIL operates a fleet of tugs, port service vessels and operations of port and terminal infrastructure and is exposed to a \\ncomplex and diverse range of marine risks, with respect to exploration vessels, oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas tankers, \\nand dry cargo vessels.\\nManagement Discussion and Analysis\\n138 139\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22 Reliance Industries LimitedFinancial  \\nStatementsGovernance  Corporate  \\nOverviewManagement  \\nReview\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The RBI is expected to remain dovish in the near term to \\nsupport growth despite global rate hikes. Overall liquidity situation is also expected to remain comfortably in surplus.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nReliance borrows funds from domestic and international markets to meet its funding requirements. Given the \\naccommodative stance from Central banks, interest rates remained low during the year and RIL benefited from it. RIL is \\nnow subject to risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates. \\nForeign Exchange (FX) Risk\\nReliance prepares its financial statements in Indian Rupee (INR), but most of the payables and receivables of the \\nHydrocarbon business are in US dollars. Foreign currency liabilities are availed to fund its capital investments and \\nworking capital requirements. Rupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. The \\ndepreciation for this year has been 3.7%.\\nCredit Risk\\nReliance deploys surplus liquidity primarily in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds \\nand Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk.Insurance – Risk \\nMitigation\\nReliance operations may be subject \\nto a number of circumstances which \\nare not wholly within the Company's  \\ncontrol and which could adversely \\naffect its operations. To cover such \\neventualities, Reliance maintains \\na robust risk mitigation practice \\nby transferring the insurable risk to \\ninsurer. Mostly protection is on All Risk \\nbasis which includes cover against \\nfire, explosions, natural catastrophes, \\nbreakdown, terrorism etc. Entire \\ninsurance program is designed \\nin such a way that adequate \\nprotection is available for all assets \\nbelonging to Reliance and against \\nthe liability arising out of business \\noperations.

Against this backdrop, \\nReliance's enduring commitment to 'Serve' or deliver 'Seva' to India \\nand humanity became even more crucial.

Ambani, the Company \\nre-engineered its existing facilities \\nto set up the largest production \\nfacilities in India to produce and \\ndeliver medical oxygen from a \\nsingle location in record time. The \\nCompany adopted a two-pronged \\napproach to strengthening the \\navailability of medical-grade oxygen \\nin India, including:\\n• Refocusing several industrial \\nprocesses at Reliance\\'s Jamnagar \\nand other facilities for rapid scale-\\nup in the production of medical-\\ngrade liquid oxygen.\\n• Managing the supply chain \\nby augmenting loading and \\ntransportation capacities to \\nensure the swift and safe supply \\nof oxygen to states and Union \\nTerritories across India.Despite not being a manufacturer of \\nmedical-grade oxygen historically, \\nthe Company\\'s engineers quickly \\nreconfigured and optimised \\noperations, which were initially \\ndesigned for refining and producing \\npetrochemical grade oxygen to \\nproduce high-purity medical-grade \\noxygen during the second wave of the \\npandemic. Reliance also converted \\nnitrogen tankers into transport trucks \\nfor medical-grade oxygen through \\ninnovative and safe processes \\napproved by the Petroleum and \\nExplosives Safety Organisation (PESO), \\nthe relevant regulatory body of the \\nGovernment of India.\\nIn the words of Chairman and Managing \\nDirector Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, \"For me \\nand all of us at Reliance, nothing is \\nmore important than saving every \\nlife as India battles against a new \\nwave of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nThere is an immediate need to \\nmaximise India\\'s production and \\ntransportation capacities for medical \\ngrade oxygen. I am proud of our \\nengineers at Jamnagar who have \\nworked tirelessly, with a great sense \\nof patriotic urgency, to meet this \\nnew challenge. I am truly humbled \\nby the determination and sense of \\npurpose shown by the bright, young members of the Reliance family \\nwho have once again risen to the \\noccasion and delivered when India \\nneeds it the most.\"\\nExpanding COVID Care \\nFacilities \\n• As the second wave of COVID-19 \\ninfections gripped the country, \\nReliance BP Mobility Limited \\n(RBML, Operating under the brand \\nname Jio-bp) reintroduced its \\nprogramme of supplying fuel \\nfree of cost to COVID emergency \\nservices vehicles.

Of this, 9.4 lakh doses were \\ngiven to various state governments \\nand 2 lakh to the armed forces.Since its inception, Reliance has been \\ncommitted to sustainable growth, \\nwhich has only been possible due \\nto the underpinning governance. \\nThe Company recognises the role of \\nrobust governance mechanisms for \\nlong-term value creation.

It takes \\nproactive initiatives to accelerate \\nthe change and has enhanced its \\ninternal governance framework to \\nminimise and mitigate risk. Reliance is \\nworking on a multipronged approach \\ncovering various aspects of the \\ncircular economy through a cradle-\\nto-cradle approach. It has identified \\nshort, medium and long term \\nstrategies to accelerate the progress \\nof circularity for plastics. In the short \\nterm, the focus is on increasing the \\nCompany’s PET recycling footprint \\nand usage of Multi-layered Plastics \\n(MLP) for road construction. In the \\nmedium term, it is focusing on \\npolyolefin recycling. In the long term, \\nthe Company is looking at chemical recycling alternatives such as Waste \\nto Oil (W2O) and Hydrothermal \\nLiquefaction (HTL), among others.\\nReliance supports projects that \\nencourage circularity, such as the \\ndevelopment of the R|ELANTM fabric, in \\nrecognition of the growing consumer \\npreference for environmentally-\\nfriendly products. The Company \\nis also developing commercial \\nscale continuous catalytic pyrolysis \\ntechnology.

The Company has a substantial workforce that is under the \\nage of 30 (representing 55.2%), and in the consumer facing businesses the Company also provides job opportunities to \\nthe employees in the Non-Supervisory category (over 50% as shown in the graphs below). Nonetheless, there are factors \\nwhich contribute to separations and the Company recognises that these are inevitable and monitors them as an \\nimportant matrix for employee retention. \\nFor RIL, the most common reasons for the voluntary separations have been identified as – diverse career advancement \\nopportunities available in the market, pursuing higher education, and relocating to areas closer to home.  \\nIn the digital services business voluntary separations was primarily driven by specific frontline non-supervisory roles \\npertaining to sales and service. \\nRetail employs a young staff, typically in the twenties.

The ingredients \\nhave successfully replaced the \\nprevalent and environmentally \\nregressive fish meal ingredient from \\nvarious applications.Reliance has also developed \\nMicrobial cell factories for \\nfermentation production of one of \\nthe strongest biomaterials such \\nas Spider Silk for advanced fabric \\nand personal care application. \\nCollaboration with some of the \\nleading personal care brands is \\nongoing for developing unique skin \\nand hair care formulations using this \\nrecombinant spider silk. \\nThe Company also leverages \\nadvanced analytical science to fast-\\ntrack innovation in biology. 'Digital \\ntongue' is an algorithm for prediction \\nof taste of the proteins and proving \\nenzyme-system to bias taste of food \\ntowards customer's requirement. \\nSeveral ML (Machine Language) \\ntools were developed and used in \\ncomputational biology platforms to \\nfabricate DNA to make novel products \\nfrom microbial cell factories. \\nThe CRISPR platform demonstrated \\ngenome alteration of algae \\nand cyanobacteria using \\nprogrammable nucleases. The \\nR&D team is working relentlessly \\nfor developing molecular tools and \\napplications of the technology for \\nagricultural and synthetic biology \\nproduct development.\\nThe team is applying this technology \\nfor higher algal biomass and novel \\nproduct development in crops \\nthat conventional methods cannot \\nproduce. The Company aims to use \\nthis path breaking technology to solve \\nsignificant challenges.\\nCoal which cannot be mined and, if \\nnot redeemed for its value in the form \\nof methane production, would be a \\nwaste of natural resources. Reliance's \\nBio CBM process is targeted at \\nconverting coal that cannot be mined \\nto methane, which will help improve \\nthe country's energy security and \\neven help reduce GHG emissions.Circular Economy \\nThe single use plastic in food \\npackaging and consumer goods \\nmostly ends up in landfills. Reliance \\nrecognises the negative impact of \\nsingle use plastic on the environment. \\nReliance is exploring sustainable \\nsolutions to reuse plastic waste \\nto promote and adopt a circular \\neconomy to tackle this menace. \\nThe Company's R&D team and the \\nSustainability Solutions team in the \\nReliance-Petchem business have \\nlaunched ReRouteTM, the only product \\nof its kind in the market today that \\ncan be used to make bituminous \\nconcrete road surfacing using the \\n'dry mix' process.\\nThe R&D team also developed net \\nbags and bag on roll applications \\nusing biodegradable plastic. These \\nhave been tested at Reliance Retail \\nstores. The materials showed excellent \\nproperties required for flexible as \\nwell as rigid packaging. Innovations \\nin biodegradable plastic technology \\nhave also moved from bench scale to \\npilot scale development. \\nReliance's low temperature \\ncontinuous catalytic pyrolysis \\ntechnology can convert plastic waste \\ncontaining multi-layer film polymers \\ninto stable oil. The technology does \\nnot require any feed segregation \\nor clean up. Additionally, this novel \\nprocess gives a higher yield and \\nenhanced stability. The produced \\nstable oil can be readily processed in \\na refinery or petrochemical units such \\nas FCC, Coker, Steam cracker, etc. Reliance uses RCAT HTL technology to \\nproduce biofuel using various organic \\nfeedstock wastes to derive value \\nfrom the waste. Produced biofuel \\ncan be utilised for heat and power \\napplications or as a transportation \\nfuel. Biofuel generated using the \\ntechnology has been successfully \\ntested in commercial engines, \\nand the technology is ready for \\ncommercialisation. The technology \\nhas the potential to significantly \\ncontribute to the Company's Net Zero \\ngoal by achieving a 25% blend in its \\nrefining capacity. \\nDiscarded PET based fabrics \\nhave a detrimental impact on \\nthe environment. As an essential \\nstep towards a circular economy \\nand addressing the challenge of \\ndiscarded PET based fabrics, the \\nCompany's R&D is targeting to \\nseparate PET from mixed fabric \\nblends and convert it back to fibers \\nand into fabric. The R&D team has \\nalso developed a process to recycle \\nwaste tyres and is exploring ways to \\nconvert waste recyclable polyester \\nmaterial into valuable chemicals to \\nmake polyurethane with improved \\nphysical properties. The team \\ndeveloped a bench process using \\na Reliance proprietary solvent to \\nseparate different layers of polymer. \\nSeparate layers can be recycled as \\nper their different functionalities and \\nprocessability.Earlier, a benign process was used \\nto recover high-value metals, \\nvanadium and nickel, from petcoke \\ncinder, which is a leftover by the \\nproduct from entrained flow \\ngasifiers. Hydro process demands \\na large quantity of acid or alkali for \\nleaching, and pyro process involves \\nvery high temperature (> 1,700OC). \\nThe R&D team has developed a \\nhybrid process where salt roasting \\nat low temperature, followed by \\nhydrometallurgical processing steps, \\nleads to the extraction of vanadium \\nand nickel at a significantly lower cost \\nthan the conventional process. R&D \\nteam is also pursuing various national \\nand international collaborative \\nprojects to utilise CO2.\\nINTELLECTUAL CAPITAL\\nApproach: The Polymer R&D team \\ndeveloped a novel process using \\nin-house developed chemical \\n‘RESOLVE’ for separation of polymer \\nlayers in multilayer packaging. \\nThe process is a simple two-step \\napproach using ‘RELSOLVE’ separating \\nmedium and it avoids the complex \\nmultistep process involving various \\nsolvents and antisolvents for the \\nrecovery of the polymer layers.\\nImpact:  The process helps in \\nrecovering the polymer layer in pure \\nform without dissolution.\\nIntegrated Approach to Sustainable Growth\\n196 197\\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22 Reliance Industries LimitedFinancial  \\nStatementsGovernance  Corporate  \\nOverviewManagement  \\nReview\\nChemical Recycling \\nof Multilayer \\nPackaging Material\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

UV-light meditated \\nphotochlorination of PVC to CPVC \\nis a common industrial practice \\nto produce CPVC resin. Reliance \\nhas developed in-house visible \\nlight mediated photochlorination \\nby replacing hazardous UV light. \\nThe CPVC has improved resin \\nproperties than the commercially \\navailable option. • R&D team has developed \\nan innovative, green, and \\ncommercially viable process \\nto produce selective infrared \\ntransmitting polymeric materials. \\nThe NIR-transmitting material is \\nproduced through solid-state \\nreactive processing and is cheaper, \\nnon-toxic, air and moisture stable \\nwith the added advantage \\nof the flexibility to mould into \\nthe desired shape.\\n• R&D team is developing \\ntechnologies to make low-\\ncost carbon fibers using \\nvarious raw materials.\\n• There is a growing demand for \\nnovel solutions that provide \\nprotection to process and structural \\ncomponents from corrosive \\nenvironment. R&D team has \\ndeveloped thermoset composite \\nsolutions that can be coated on \\nsurfaces to provide adequate \\nprotection from mild to the harsh \\ncorrosive environments.\\nAffordable and Clean Energy \\nReliance believes that climate \\nchange presents an opportunity \\nto create a healthier, happier, and \\nsustainable planet. Affordable and \\nclean energy options will realise this \\nopportunity for humanity. The R&D \\nteam has been operating a large \\npilot facility near Jamnagar, where it \\nconverts sunlight, CO2 and seawater \\nto renewable bio-crude. The ponds \\nhave been operating continuously \\nwithout any failure for more than \\nfour years. No other organisation in \\nthe world has been able to cultivate \\nalgae without crashes and significant \\ndowntime. Reliance has developed \\nall the technology components which \\nwill be instrumental in converting \\nCO2 to useful products to combat \\nclimate change.The Company has \\nalso developed a \\ncatalytic gasification \\ntechnology that can \\nconvert a variety \\nof carbonaceous \\nfeedstocks like \\npetcoke, coal, \\nbiomass, etc. into \\nhydrogen and \\nsyngas.\\nThe novel catalytic process can \\nbe used to convert challenging \\nfeedstocks like high-ash Indian \\ncoal and agricultural residue into \\nhydrogen or syngas. The Company \\nhas successfully completed plant \\ntesting of the technology with \\ndifferent agricultural residues and \\nhigh-ash Indian coal, and 10 TPD plant \\ncapacity is being worked out.\\nA high temperature-polymer \\nelectrolyte membrane (HT-PEM) fuel \\ncell system has been built and is \\npresently being tested on simulated \\nReliance-Jio towers. In coming years \\nrenewable hydrogen will supply fuel \\ncells to produce in-situ hydrogen.\\nOil to Chemicals (O2C) \\nFossil fuels like gasoline and diesel \\nhave a high carbon footprint \\nimpacting the environment. \\nHaving committed to a Net Zero \\ntarget by 2035, Reliance strives to \\nexplore innovative options to adopt \\nsustainable practices. Reliance's \\nMultizone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) \\nis an in-house disruptive innovation \\nto generate chemical building blocks \\nfor speciality materials from refinery \\nstreams or whole crude instead of \\nfuels. The MCC is a vital technology \\nenabler that will help in Jamnagar's \\nO2C transformation. The 3KBPSD MCC \\ndemo plant is in the advanced design \\nstage and has been constructed \\nfor a demonstration before building \\na full-scale commercial plant. A\\xa0unique technology has also been \\ndeveloped to separate the aromatics \\nBTX component from olefinic MCC \\ngasoline and recycle the raffinate \\nstream to MCC riser for maximising \\npetrochemicals production.\\nRefining and Petrochemicals \\nReliance has developed a high-\\ncapacity sodium removal adsorbent \\nand a process to remove trace \\namounts of sodium from disulphide \\noil (DSO). This solution has been \\ncommercialised at Jamnagar. \\nThe treated DSO is being utilised in \\nReliance's Refinery Off-Gas Cracker \\n(ROGC) unit replacing imported costly \\nadditive, Dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). \\nA facility is also being developed at \\nthe JMD to transport the product to \\nReliance's other petrochemical sites \\nto use them in-stream crackers.\\nThe R&D team has developed an \\nin-house RELOX (Reliance Oxidation) \\ncatalyst for the purification of \\nnitrogen gas streams. The RELOX \\ncatalyst purifies nitrogen gas \\nstreams containing hydrocarbon \\nimpurities and is used in the nitrogen \\npurification unit. The RELOX catalyst \\nis being supplied to the PET HMD \\nsite, where production is in progress. \\nThe Company aims to use RELOX catalyst in all PET plants for nitrogen \\ngas purification.\\nThermic fluids are predominantly \\nused in high temperature process \\napplications between 150O C and \\n400O\\xa0C. For the first time globally, the \\nR&D team has developed an in-house \\nnovel adsorbent and a process for \\nthe online purification of thermic \\nfluids. The technology has been \\ncommissioned at Dahej and Silvassa \\nplants and is under commissioning \\nin Hazira. Besides being superior \\nto conventional techniques like \\ndistillation and alkali wash, this \\ntechnology is environmentally friendly \\nand cost effective.\\nThe R&D team has developed \\nREL-ORCAT, a proprietary catalytic \\ntechnology, for olefins removal or \\nBI reduction from aromatics rich \\nhydrocarbon streams. The technology \\nwith its superior catalyst has the \\npotential to replace conventionally \\nused clay-based catalyst. The team \\nhas also developed an eco-friendly, \\nsingle-step adsorptive process to \\npurify recycling/waste MEG generated \\nin polyester plants. Further, to \\nmaximise propylene yield, conversion \\nand reduce the coke make, the team \\nhas developed a process for High \\nActive FCC catalyst. \\nBiodegradation is the most \\nsustainable and economical way \\nof industrial effluent treatment, as \\nit leads to terminal conversion of \\norganic pollutants into microbial \\nbiomass without leaving behind \\ntoxic residues. Once established, it’s \\na self-regenerating system. Tailor \\nmade microbial consortia have been \\ndeveloped, scaled, and implemented \\nfor consistent chemical oxygen \\ndemand (COD) remediation at the \\npolyester ETP plant at Patalganga \\nManufacturing Division (PMD). \\nSimilarly, a specialised microbial \\nconsortium has been implemented \\nfor COD reduction at Silvassa \\nManufacturing Division (SMD) for \\nsmooth and uninterrupted operations. \\nClimate action \\nR&D team has developed a mixed \\noxide stable catalyst to convert \\nmethanol and CO2 to a high-value \\nDi-methyl carbonate (DMC) product \\nthat can be used as a solvent and \\nspecialty chemical. The process \\nand the catalyst have been scaled \\nup to a pilot stage. The team has \\nalso developed a sorbent based \\ncirculating fluidised bed process \\nfor concentrating CO2 from dilute \\nrefinery and power plant flue \\ngases. The process is protected by \\nseveral patents.\\nUnder RIL's flagship programme, \\nAlgae to Oil, the R&D team has \\ndeveloped a technology that utilises \\nabundant sunlight, waste CO2 and \\nsea water, to produce valuable \\nproducts. This process has a huge \\npotential to utilise atmospheric CO2 \\nand convert it to a valuable green \\ncrude oil, thus reducing the carbon \\nfootprint to a significant extent and \\ncombating climate change.

The objective is to meet \\nstakeholders’ aspirations and societal \\nexpectations. Good governance \\npractices stem from the dynamic \\nculture and positive mindset of the \\norganisation. We are committed \\nto meet the aspirations of all our \\nstakeholders. This is demonstrated \\nin shareholder returns, high credit \\nratings, awards and recognitions, \\ngovernance processes and an \\nentrepreneurial performance focussed \\nwork environment. Additionally, our \\ncustomers have been benefited from \\nhigh quality products delivered at \\nextremely competitive prices.\\nThe essence of Corporate Governance \\nlies in promoting and maintaining \\nintegrity, transparency and \\naccountability in the management’s \\nhigher echelons. The demands \\nof Corporate Governance require \\nprofessionals to raise their competence \\nand capability levels to meet the \\nexpectations in managing the \\nenterprise and its resources effectively \\nwith the highest standards of \\nethics. It has thus become crucial \\nto foster and sustain a culture that \\nintegrates all components of good \\ngovernance by carefully balancing the \\ninter -relationship among the Board of \\nDirectors, Board Committees, Finance, \\nCompliance & Assurance teams, \\nAuditors and the Senior Management. \\nOur employee satisfaction is reflected \\nin the stability of senior management, \\nability to attract talent across \\nvarious levels and substantially \\nhigher productivity. Above all, we feel \\nhonoured to be integral to India’s social \\ndevelopment. Details of several such \\ninitiatives are available in the Report on \\nCorporate Social Responsibility.\\nAt RIL, Corporate Governance is \\nall about maintaining a valuable \\nrelationship and trust with all the \\nstakeholders. We consider stakeholders \\nas partners in our success and remain committed to maximising \\nstakeholders’ value, be it Customers, \\nLocal Communities, Employees, \\nSuppliers & Distributors, Trade Unions, \\nNGOs, Investors & Shareholders and \\nGovernment & Regulatory Authorities. \\nThis approach to value creation \\nemanates from RIL’s belief that \\nsound governance system, based \\non relationship and trust, is integral \\nto creating enduring value for all. We \\nhave a defined policy framework for \\nethical conduct of businesses. We \\nbelieve that any business conduct \\ncan be ethical only when it rests on \\nthe six core values viz. Customer Value, \\nOwnership Mindset, Respect, Integrity, \\nOne Team and Excellence.\\nAt RIL, we believe that as we move \\ncloser towards our aspirations of being \\na global corporation, our Corporate \\nGovernance standards must be \\nglobally benchmarked. Therefore, we \\nhave institutionalised the right building \\nblocks for future growth. The building \\nblocks will ensure that we achieve our \\nambition in a prudent and sustainable \\nmanner. RIL not only adheres to the \\nprescribed Corporate Governance \\npractices as per the Listing \\nRegulations, but is also committed \\nto sound Corporate Governance \\nprinciples and practices. It constantly \\nstrives to adopt emerging best \\npractices being followed worldwide. \\nIt is our endeavour to achieve higher \\nstandards and provide oversight \\nand guidance to the management \\nin strategy implementation, risk \\nmanagement and fulfilment of stated \\ngoals and objectives.\\nOver the years, we have strengthened \\ngovernance practices. These practices \\ndefine the way how business is \\nconducted and value is generated. \\nStakeholders’ interests are taken into \\naccount before making any business \\ndecision. RIL has the distinction of \\nconsistently rewarding its shareholders \\nfor over four eventful decades from \\nInitial Public Offer (IPO). Since then, \\nRIL has moved from one big idea \\nto another and these milestones \\ncontinue to fuel its relentless pursuit of \\never-higher goals.\\nOn standalone basis, we have \\ngrown by a Compounded Annual \\nGrowth Rate (CAGR) of Revenues 22.2%, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, \\nDepreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) \\nbefore exceptional items 23.1% and Net \\nProfit before exceptional items 24.1%. \\nThe financial markets have endorsed \\nour sterling performance and the \\nmarket capitalisation has increased by \\nCAGR of 31.6% during the same period. \\nIn terms of distributing wealth to our \\nshareholders, apart from having a \\ntrack record of uninterrupted dividend \\npayout, we have also delivered \\nconsistent unmatched shareholder \\nreturns since listing. The result of our \\ninitiative is our ever widening reach \\nand recall. Our shareholder base \\nhas grown from 52,000 after the IPO \\nto a consolidated present base of \\naround 33 Lakh.\\nFor decades, RIL is growing in step \\nwith India’s industrial and economic \\ndevelopment. The Company has \\nhelped transform the Indian economy \\nwith large projects and world-class \\nexecution. The quest to help elevate \\nIndia’s quality of life continues and \\nis unabated. It emanates from a \\nfundamental article of faith: ‘What is \\ngood for India is good for Reliance’.\\nWe believe, Corporate Governance is \\nnot just a destination, but a journey to \\nconstantly improve sustainable value \\ncreation. It is an upward-moving target \\nthat we collectively strive towards \\nachieving. Our multiple initiatives \\ntowards maintaining the highest \\nstandards of governance are detailed \\nin this Report.\\n Corporate Governance \\nStructure, Policies and \\nPractices\\nThe Company has put in place an \\ninternal multi -tier governance structure \\nwith defined roles and responsibilities \\nof every constituent of the system. \\nThe Company’s shareholders appoint \\nthe Board of Directors, which in turn \\ngovern the Company. The Board has \\nestablished various Committees to \\ndischarge its responsibilities in an \\neffective manner. The Chairman and \\nManaging Director (CMD) provides \\noverall direction and guidance to \\nthe Board. In the operations and \\nfunctioning of the Company, the CMD is \\nassisted by four Executive Directors and \\na core group of senior level executives.Corporate Governance Report\\nK.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable \\nto the acquisition or construction of qualifying \\nassets are capitalised as part of the cost of such \\nassets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily \\ntakes substantial period of time to get ready for \\nits intended use.\\n   Interest income earned on the temporary investment \\nof specific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing \\ncosts eligible for capitalisation.\\n   All other borrowing costs are charged to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss for the period for which \\nthey are incurred.\\n (h) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing for \\nobsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products \\nwhich are valued at net realisable value. Cost \\nof inventories comprises of cost of purchase, \\ncost of conversion and other costs including \\nmanufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes \\nincurred in bringing them to their respective present \\nlocation and condition.\\n   Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw \\nmaterials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing \\nmaterials, trading and other products are \\ndetermined on weighted average basis.\\n (i)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets \\n- Property, Plant and Equipment and \\nIntangible Assets\\n    The Company assesses at each reporting date as \\nto whether there is any indication that any Property, \\nPlant and Equipment and Intangible Assets or \\ngroup of Assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) \\nmay be impaired. If any such indication exists, the \\nrecoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated \\nto determine the extent of impairment, if any. When \\nit is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, the Company estimates \\nthe recoverable amount of the CGU to which \\nthe asset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss to the extent, asset’s carrying amount \\nexceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of \\ndisposal and value in use. Value in use is based on \\nthe estimated future cash flows, discounted to their \\npresent value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects \\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of \\nmoney and risk specific to the assets.\\n   The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting \\nperiod is reversed if there has been a change in the \\nestimate of recoverable amount.\\n (j) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Company has \\na present obligation (legal or constructive) as a \\nresult of a past event, it is probable that an outflow \\nof resources embodying economic benefits will \\nbe required to settle the obligation and a reliable \\nestimate can be made of the amount of the \\nobligation. If the effect of the time value of money is \\nmaterial, provisions are discounted using a current \\npre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks \\nspecific to the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of time \\nis recognised as a finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Company records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided at \\nthe present value of future expenditure using a \\ncurrent pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil \\ndecommissioning obligations and are recognised as \\npart of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change \\nin the present value of the expenditure, other than \\nunwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as \\nadjustment to the provision and the corresponding \\nasset. The change in the provision due to the \\nunwinding of discount is recognised in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n (k) Contingent Liabilities\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when there \\nis a possible obligation arising from past events, \\nthe existence of which will be confirmed only by \\nthe occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more \\nuncertain future events not wholly within the control \\nof the Company or a present obligation that arises \\nfrom past events where it is either not probable \\nthat an outflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle or a reliable \\nestimate of amount cannot be made.\\n (l) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term employee \\nbenefits expected to be paid in exchange for the \\nservices rendered by employees are recognised as \\nan expense during the period when the employees \\nrender the services.  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Company recognises contribution payable to \\nthe provident fund scheme as an expense, when \\nan employee renders the related service. If the \\ncontribution payable to the scheme for service \\nreceived before the balance sheet date exceeds \\nthe contribution already paid, the deficit payable \\nto the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the \\ncontribution already paid exceeds the contribution \\ndue for services received before the balance sheet \\ndate, then excess is recognised as an asset to the \\nextent that the pre-payment will lead to a reduction \\nin future payment or a cash refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Company pays gratuity to the employees \\nwho have completed five years of service with the \\nCompany at the time of resignation/superannuation. \\nThe gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every \\ncompleted year of service as per the Payment of \\nGratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is \\ncontributed to the approved gratuity fund formed \\nexclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. \\nThe gratuity fund has been approved by respective \\nIncome Tax authorities. The liability in respect of \\ngratuity and other post-employment benefits is \\ncalculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method \\nand spread over the period during which the benefit \\nis expected to be derived from employees’ services.\\n   Remeasurement gains and losses arising from \\nadjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recognised in the period in which they occur in \\nOther Comprehensive Income.\\n   Employee Separation Costs: The Company \\nrecognises the employee separation cost when \\nthe scheme is announced, and the Company is \\ndemonstrably committed to it.\\n (m) Tax Expenses\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprises of current \\ntax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent \\nthat it relates to items recognised in the Other \\nComprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is \\nalso recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\\n  i.  Current Tax\\n    Current tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from \\nor paid to the Income Tax authorities, based \\non tax rates and laws that are enacted at the \\nBalance sheet date.\\n  ii. Deferred Tax\\n    Deferred tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the \\ncomputation of taxable profit.\\n    Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent \\nit is probable that taxable profit will be available \\nagainst which the deductible temporary \\ndifferences, and the carry forward of unused \\ntax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities \\nand assets are measured at the tax rates that \\nare expected to apply in the period in which the \\nliability is settled or the asset realised, based \\non tax rates (and tax laws) that have been \\nenacted or substantively enacted by the end \\nof the reporting period. The carrying amount of \\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period.\\n (n) Share Based Payments\\n   Equity-settled share based payments to employees \\nand others providing similar services are measured \\nat the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant \\ndate. Details regarding the determination of the \\nfair value of equity-settled share based payments \\ntransactions are set out in Note 29.2.\\n   The fair value determined at the grant date of the \\nequity-settled share based payments is expensed on \\na straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on \\nthe Company’s estimate of equity instruments that \\nwill eventually vest, with a corresponding increase \\nin equity. At the end of each reporting period, the \\nCompany revises its estimate of the number of equity \\ninstruments expected to vest. The impact of the \\nrevision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss such that the \\ncumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, \\nwith a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based \\nPayments Reserve.\\n   The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected \\nas additional share dilution in the computation of \\ndiluted earnings per share.\\n   In case of Group equity-settled share-based \\npayment transactions, where the Company grants \\nstock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, the \\ntransactions are accounted by increasing the cost \\nof investment in subsidiary with a corresponding \\ncredit in the equity.\\n (o)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the \\nexchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. \\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in \\nforeign currencies are translated at the functional \\ncurrency closing rates of exchange at the reporting \\ndate.

The gain or loss arising on translation \\nof non-monetary items measured at fair value is \\ntreated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss \\non the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation \\ndifferences on items whose fair value gain or loss \\nis recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or \\nStatement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where a \\nnon-monetary advance is paid/received, the date \\nof transaction is the date on which the advance was \\ninitially recognised. If there were multiple payments \\nor receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions \\nare determined for each payment or receipt of \\nadvance consideration.\\n (p) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised \\nwhen control of the goods or services are transferred \\nto the customer at an amount that reflects the \\nconsideration entitled in exchange for those goods \\nor services. The Company is generally the principal \\nas it typically controls the goods or services before \\ntransferring them to the customer.\\n   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment of \\ngoods to the customer or when the goods is made \\navailable to the customer, provided transfer of title \\nto the customer occurs and the Company has not \\nretained any significant risks of ownership or future \\nobligations with respect to the goods shipped.\\n   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised \\nover time by measuring the progress towards \\ncomplete satisfaction of performance obligations at \\nthe reporting period.\\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration \\nwhich the Company expects to be entitled to in \\nexchange for transferring distinct goods or services \\nto a customer as specified in the contract, excluding \\namounts collected on behalf of third parties (for \\nexample taxes and duties collected on behalf of \\nthe government). Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction of performance obligations \\nand a receivable is recognised when it becomes \\nunconditional. Generally, the credit period varies \\nbetween 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of \\ngoods or services as the case may be. The Company \\nprovides volume rebates to certain customers once \\nthe quantity of products purchased during the period \\nexceeds a threshold specified and also accrues \\ndiscounts to certain customers based on customary \\nbusiness practices which is derived on the basis of \\ncrude price volatility and various market demand \\n– supply situations. Consideration are determined \\nbased on its most likely amount. Generally, sales \\nof petroleum products contain provisional pricing \\nfeatures where revenue is initially recognised based \\non provisional price.\\n   Difference between final settlement price and \\nprovisional price is recognised subsequently. The \\nCompany does not adjust short-term advances \\nreceived from the customer for the effects of \\nsignificant financing component if it is expected at \\nthe contract inception that the promised good or \\nservice will be transferred to the customer within a \\nperiod of one year.\\n  Contract Balances\\n  Trade Receivables\\n   A receivable represents the Company’s right to an \\namount of consideration that is unconditional.\\n  Contract Liabilities\\n   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods \\nor services to a customer for which the Company has \\nreceived consideration or is due from the customer. If \\na customer pays consideration before the Company \\ntransfers goods or services to the customer, a \\ncontract liability is recognised when the payment is \\nmade or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\\n   Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when \\nthe Company performs under the contract.\\n  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a Financial Assets is recognised \\nusing effective interest rate method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the Company’s \\nright to receive the amount has been established.\\n (q) Financial Instruments\\n  i. Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nFinancial Assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale \\nof Financial Assets are recognised using trade \\ndate accounting.\\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n  a)  Financial Assets measured at \\nAmortised Cost (AC)\\n    A Financial Asset is measured at Amortised \\nCost if it is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is to hold the asset in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the contractual \\nterms of the Financial Asset give rise to cash \\nflows on specified dates that represent solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n  b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair \\nValue Through Other Comprehensive \\nIncome (FVTOCI)\\n    A Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is \\nheld within a business model whose objective \\nis achieved by both collecting contractual \\ncash flows and selling Financial Assets and \\nthe contractual terms of the Financial Asset \\ngive rise on specified dates to cash flows that \\nrepresents solely payments of principal and \\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n  c)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\\n    A Financial Asset which is not classified in any \\nof the above categories are measured at FVTPL. \\nFinancial assets are reclassified subsequent \\nto their recognition, if the Company changes \\nits business model for managing those \\nfinancial assets. Changes in business model \\nare made and applied prospectively from the \\nreclassification date which is the first day of \\nimmediately next reporting period following \\nthe changes in business model in accordance \\nwith principles laid down under Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments.\\n  C.  Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates \\nand Joint Ventures\\n    The Company has accounted for its \\ninvestments in Subsidiaries, associates and \\njoint venture at cost less impairment loss (if \\nany). The investments in preference shares with \\nthe right of surplus assets which are in nature of \\nequity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are treated \\nas separate category of investment and \\nmeasured at FVTOCI.\\n  D. Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured at \\nfair value, with value changes recognised in \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except for those \\nequity investments for which the Company has elected to present the value changes \\nin ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. However, \\ndividend on such equity investments are \\nrecognised in Statement of Profit and loss \\nwhen the\\xa0Company’s right to receive payment \\nis established.\\n  E. Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company \\nuses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for \\nevaluating impairment of Financial Assets other \\nthan those measured at Fair Value Through \\nProfit and Loss (FVTPL).\\n    Expected Credit Losses are measured through a \\nloss allowance at an amount equal to:\\n•  The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from those \\ndefault events on the financial instrument \\nthat are possible within 12 months after the \\nreporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For Trade Receivables the Company applies \\n‘simplified approach’ which requires expected \\nlifetime losses to be recognised from initial \\nrecognition of the receivables.\\n    The Company uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Company uses 12 month \\nECL to provide for impairment loss where \\nthere is no significant increase in credit risk. \\nIf there is significant increase in credit risk full \\nlifetime ECL is used.\\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A.  Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Liabilities are recognised at fair \\nvalue and in case of borrowings, net of directly \\nattributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are \\ndirectly recognised in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss as finance cost.\\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within one \\nyear from the balance sheet date, the carrying \\namounts approximate fair value due to the \\nshort maturity of these instruments.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Company uses various derivative financial \\ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \\ncurrency swaps, forwards & options and \\ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk of \\nchanges in interest rates, exchange rates and \\ncommodity prices. At the inception of a hedge \\nrelationship, the Company formally designates \\nand documents the hedge relationship to \\nwhich the Company wishes to apply hedge \\naccounting and the risk management objective \\nand strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such \\nderivative financial instruments are initially \\nrecognised at fair value on the date on which a \\nderivative contract is entered into and are also \\nsubsequently measured at fair value.\\n    Derivatives are carried as Financial Assets \\nwhen the fair value is positive and as Financial \\nLiabilities when the fair value is negative. Any \\ngains or losses arising from changes in the \\nfair value of derivatives are taken directly to \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except for the \\neffective portion of cash flow hedge which is \\nrecognised in Other Comprehensive Income \\nand later to Statement of Profit and Loss \\nwhen the hedged item affects profit or loss \\nor is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in the \\nrecognition of a Non-Financial Assets or Non-\\nFinancial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative Financial Assets/ Liabilities \\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the risk \\nof movement in interest rates and foreign \\nexchange rates for foreign exchange \\nexposure on highly probable future cash flows \\nattributable to a recognised asset or liability or \\nforecast cash transactions.\\n    When a derivative is designated as a cash \\nflow hedging instrument, the effective portion \\nof changes in the fair value of the derivative \\nis recognised in the cash flow hedging \\nreserve being part of Other Comprehensive \\nIncome. Any ineffective portion of changes in \\nthe fair value of the derivative is recognised \\nimmediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\nIf the hedging relationship no longer meets \\nthe criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge \\naccounting is discontinued prospectively. If \\nthe hedging instrument expires or is sold or \\nterminated or exercised, the cumulative gain \\nor loss on the hedging instrument recognised \\nin cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash \\nflow hedging reserve until the underlying \\ntransaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss \\npreviously recognised in the cash flow hedging \\nreserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying \\ntransaction. If the forecasted transaction is no \\nlonger expected to occur, then the amount \\naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is \\nreclassified in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n  B. Fair Value Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative Financial Assets/Liabilities \\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the risk \\nof change in fair value of hedged item due to \\nmovement in interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates and commodity prices.\\n    Changes in the fair value of hedging \\ninstruments and hedged items that are \\ndesignated and qualify as fair value hedges \\nare recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\nIf the hedging relationship no longer meets the \\ncriteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment \\nto the carrying amount of a hedged item for \\nwhich the effective interest method is used is \\namortised to Statement of Profit and Loss over \\nthe period of maturity.\\n  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n    The Company derecognises a Financial Asset \\nwhen the contractual rights to the cash flows \\nfrom the Financial Asset expire or it transfers \\nthe Financial Asset and the transfer qualifies \\nfor derecognition under Ind AS 109. A Financial \\nliability (or a part of a Financial liability) is \\nderecognised from the Company’s Balance \\nSheet when the obligation specified in the \\ncontract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\\n  v.  Offsetting\\n    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \\nCompany has a legally enforceable right to set \\noff the amount and it intends, either to settle \\nthem on a net basis or to realise the asset and \\nsettle the liability simultaneously.\\n (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-current assets are classified as held for \\nsale if their carrying amount will be recovered \\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use and sale is considered \\nhighly probable.\\n   A sale is considered as highly probable when \\ndecision has been made to sell, assets are available \\nfor immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been \\nagreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 \\nmonths of the date of classification.\\n   Non-current assets held for sale are neither \\ndepreciated nor amortised.\\n   Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and \\nfair value less cost of disposal and are presented \\nseparately in the Balance Sheet.\\n (s) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Company has adopted Successful Efforts \\nMethod (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas \\nactivities. The policy of recognition of exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure is considered in line \\nwith the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological \\nand geophysical studies, petroleum exploration \\nlicense fees and general and administration costs \\ndirectly attributable to exploration and evaluation \\nactivities are expensed off. The costs incurred on \\nacquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on \\nexploration and evaluation other than those which \\nare expensed off are accounted for as Intangible \\nAssets Under Development. All development \\ncosts incurred in respect of proved reserves are \\nalso capitalised under Intangible Assets Under \\nDevelopment. Once a well is ready to commence \\ncommercial production, the costs accumulated in \\nIntangible Assets Under Development are classified \\nas Intangible Assets corresponding to proved \\ndeveloped oil and gas reserves. The exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure which does not result \\nin discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all \\ncost pertaining to production are charged to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n   The Company uses technical estimation of reserves \\nas per the Petroleum Resources Management \\nSystem guidelines 2011 and standard geological and \\nreservoir engineering methods. The reserve review \\nand evaluation is carried out annually.\\n   Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of joint \\noperations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as \\nwell as income and expenditure are accounted on \\nthe basis of available information on a line-by-line \\nbasis with similar items in the Company’s Financial \\nStatements, according to the participating interest \\nof the Company.\\n (t) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used \\nin determination of basic earnings per share to take \\ninto account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are \\ndeemed converted as at the beginning of the \\nperiod unless issued at a later date.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements and \\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements \\nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about \\nthese assumptions and estimates could result in \\noutcomes that require a material adjustment to the \\ncarrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in next \\nfinancial years.\\n(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Company’s estimates of \\nits oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases \\nit’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement \\nof reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and \\ncommercial assessments based on conventional \\nindustry practice and regulatory requirements.\\n  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to \\ncalculate depletion charges for the Company’s oil and \\ngas properties. The impact of changes in estimated \\nproved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising \\nthe remaining carrying value of the asset over the \\nexpected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves \\nalso have a direct impact on the assessment of the \\nrecoverability of asset carrying values reported in the \\nFinancial Statements.\\n  Details on proved reserves and production \\nboth on product and geographical basis are \\nprovided in Note 35.1.\\n(B) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs is recognised \\nwhen the Company has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include; the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Property, \\nPlant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/\\namortised over their estimated useful life, after taking \\ninto account estimated residual value. Management \\nreviews the estimated useful life and residual values of \\nthe assets annually in order to determine the amount \\nof depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during \\nany reporting period. The useful life and residual values \\nare based on the Company’s historical experience \\nwith similar assets and take into account anticipated \\ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation/\\namortisation for future periods is revised if there are \\nsignificant changes from previous estimates.\\n(D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgments are required in assessing the recoverability \\nof overdue trade receivables and determining whether \\na provision against those receivables is required. Factors \\nconsidered include the credit rating of the counterparty, \\nthe amount and timing of anticipated future payments \\nand any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate \\nthe risk of non-payment.\\n(E) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of the \\nliability (including litigations) requires the application \\nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, \\nwhich can be subject to change. The carrying amounts \\nof provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly \\nand revised to take account of changing facts \\nand circumstances.\\n(F)  Impairment of Financial and Non-\\nFinancial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are \\nbased on assumptions about risk of default and \\nexpected cash loss rates. The Company uses judgement \\nin making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to \\nthe impairment calculation, based on Company’s past \\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-\\nlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, assessment of \\nimpairment indicators involves consideration of \\nfuture risks. Further, the company estimates asset’s \\nrecoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or \\nCash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of \\ndisposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments \\nof the time value of money and the risks specific to the \\nasset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, \\nrecent market transactions are taken into account, if \\nno such transactions can be identified, an appropriate \\nvaluation model is used.\\n(G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and \\nLiabilities\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for \\ndeductible temporary differences and unused tax losses \\nfor which there is probability of utilisation against the \\nfuture taxable profit. The Company uses judgement \\nto determine the amount of deferred tax that can be \\nrecognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of \\nfuture taxable profits and business developments.\\n(H) Fair Value Measurement\\n  For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer note 38 of financial statements.\\n(I) Global Health Pandemic on Covid-19\\n  The continuance of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic \\nglobally and in India is causing significant disturbance \\nand slowdown of economic activity. The Company’s \\noperations and revenue during the period were \\nimpacted due to COVID-19. The Company has taken into \\naccount the possible impact of COVID-19 in preparation \\nof financial statements, including its assessment of \\nrecoverable value of its assets based on internal and \\nexternal information upto the date of approval of these \\nfinancial statements and current indicators of future \\neconomic conditions.\\nD.

The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably \\npossible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions \\nconstant.

An increase in the life \\nexpectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.\\nSalary RiskThe present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan \\nparticipants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. 29.2 Share Based Payments\\n  a) Scheme details\\n    The Company has Employee Stock Option Schemes i.e. ESOS-2006 and ESOS-2017 under which options have been \\ngranted at the various exercise prices to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility \\ncriteria.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of \\nthe PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. \\nThe Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million \\n(` 1,248 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand $ 247 million- ` 1,872 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has \\nbeen considered as contingent liability.\\n     In supersession of Ministry’s Gazette Notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified the \\nNew Domestic natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit \\ndifferential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted \\nto NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account \\nmaintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ` 295 crore (net) as at \\n31st March, 2022 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets. Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\\n      Tribunal has scheduled further procedural hearing in the matter.\\n 35.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US $1.55 \\nbillion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents \\nof the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th \\nJuly, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award \\nof the Arbitral Tribunal on 15th November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. The Appeal is currently being heard \\nbefore the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.\\n    (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and RIL (together the Claimants) against GOI \\non 16th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain \\nPSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), \\nand separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the \\n2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged \\nissues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large \\npart vide its final partial award dated 1st October, 2018 (‘2018 FPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English \\nCommercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld \\nClaimants’ challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal \\nfor determination. On 29th January, 2021 the Tribunal issued a further final partial award on the remitted matter and GOI \\nhas challenged the same before the English Commercial Court. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral \\nTribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule \\nthe final re-computation of accounts phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants’ \\nrequest for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\\n     GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration \\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the \\n2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards.  The Claimants contend that \\nGOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI’s Execution Petition is currently sub judice before Delhi High Court.  (c)  NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by RIL before the Hon’ble Bombay \\nHigh Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for \\nsupply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and RIL is of the \\nview that NTPC’s claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and RIL.\\n      Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/\\nlitigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\\n 35.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\\n   The following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to \\nactivity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\\n(`  in crore) \\nParticularsAs at  \\n31st March, 2022As at  \\n31st March, 2021\\nExploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost\\nExploration Expenditure written off 102 1 \\nOther Exploration Cost 79  -   \\nExploration Cost for the year 181 1 \\n(` in crore)\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2022As at  \\n31st March, 2021\\n36.

By \\nan order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives \\nin the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the \\norder; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of  ` 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November \\n29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate \\nTribunal (“SAT”) against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL \\nto pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been \\nadmitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India \\ndirected RIL to deposit ` 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the \\nrecovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal.

The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.\\n(` in crore)\\nParticularsForeign Currency Exposure\\nAs at 31st March, 2022 As at 31st March, 2021\\nUSD EUR JPY USD EUR JPY\\nBorrowings 1,15,850 11,993 10,731 96,823 12,634 11,555\\nTrade and Other Payables 1,30,415 1,154 - 81,227 2,528 -\\nTrade and Other Receivables (13,639) (244) (13) (3,692) (110) (13)\\nDerivatives\\n- Forwards & Futures (54,958) (12,500) (10,927) (55,461) (13,970) (11,528)\\n- Currency Swap - - - 2,655 - -\\n- Options (2,877) 126 (319) (19,347) (472) 727\\nExposure 1,74,791 529 (528) 1,02,205 610 741\\n     Sensitivity analysis of 1% change in exchange rate at the end of reporting period net of hedges *\\n(` in crore)\\nParticularsForeign Currency Sensitivity\\nAs at 31st March, 2022 As at 31st March, 2021\\nUSD EUR JPY USD EUR JPY\\n1% Depreciation in INR\\nImpact on Equity (165) - - (260) (11) (28)\\nImpact on P&L (114) (5) 5 (240) 11 28\\nTotal (279) (5) 5 (500) - -\\n1% Appreciation in INR\\nImpact on Equity 165 - - 260 11 28\\nImpact on P&L 114 5 (5) 240 (11) (28)\\nTotal 279 5 (5) 500 - -\\n*  Includes natural hedges arising from foreign currency denominated earnings, for which hedge accounting may be \\nimplemented.\\n   b) Interest Rate Risk\\n     The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair \\nvalues of its financial instruments, principally debt. The Company issues debt in a variety of currencies based on \\nmarket opportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.

The company has \\na risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices \\nand freight costs.\\nThe Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control \\nprocesses. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using \\nderivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its \\ncommodity and freight exposure.\\n  iii)  Credit Risk\\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives \\nand receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate \\ncreditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit \\ninformation is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify \\nand respond to cases of credit deterioration.\\nThe company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, \\nadvance payments and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The \\ncompany restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv)  Liquidity Risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company \\nmaintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global \\nand local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to \\nensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts \\nof the company’s cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times \\nincluding contingencies.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Hedge Accounting\\nThe Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil \\nand other feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has \\nadopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved \\nhedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange \\ntraded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve \\nthis objective.\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a \\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative \\nmethod and Dollar offset method.\\nThe hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n- Differences in the timing of the cash flows.\\n- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).\\n- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n  Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\\n  A.

Significant Accounting Policies\\nB.1  Basis of Preparation and Presentation\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been \\nprepared on the historical cost basis except for the \\nfollowing assets and liabilities which have been \\nmeasured at fair value:\\n i.  Certain financial assets and liabilities (including \\nderivative instruments),\\n ii.  Defined Benefit Plan’s – Plan Assets and\\n iii.  Equity settled Share Based Payments\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group \\nhave been prepared in accordance with Indian \\nAccounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 \\n(as amended from time to time) and presentation \\nrequirements of Division II of Schedule III to the \\nCompanies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as \\napplicable to the CFS.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprises \\nof Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, \\nbeing the entities that it controls. Control is assessed \\nin accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 – \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented \\nin Indian Rupees ( `) and all values are rounded \\nto the nearest crore ( ` 00,00,000), except when \\notherwise indicated.\\nB.2 Principles of Consolidation\\n (a)  The financial statements of the Holding Company \\nand its subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-\\nline basis by adding together like items of assets, \\nliabilities, equity, incomes, expenses and cash \\nflows, after fully eliminating intra-group balances \\nand intragroup transactions. (b)  Profits or losses resulting from intra-group \\ntransactions that are recognised in assets, such as \\nInventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are \\neliminated in full.\\n (c)  In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are \\nconsolidated at the average rate prevailing during \\nthe year. All assets and liabilities are converted \\nat rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any \\nexchange difference arising on consolidation is \\nrecognised in the Foreign Currency Translation \\nReserve (FCTR).\\n (d)  The audited / unaudited financial statements of \\nforeign subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates \\nhave been prepared in accordance with the \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principle of its \\nCountry of Incorporation or Ind AS.\\n (e)  The differences in accounting policies of the \\nHolding Company and its subsidiaries / joint \\nventures / associates are not material and there \\nare no material transactions from 1st January, 2022 \\nto 31st March, 2022 in respect of subsidiaries / joint \\nventures / associates having financial year ended \\n31st December, 2021.\\n (f)  The Consolidated Financial Statements have \\nbeen prepared using uniform accounting \\npolicies for like transactions and other events in \\nsimilar circumstances.\\n (g)  The carrying amount of the parent’s investment in \\neach subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against the \\nparent’s portion of equity in each subsidiary.\\n (h)  The difference between the proceeds from \\ndisposal of investment in subsidiaries and the \\ncarrying amount of its assets less liabilities \\nas on the date of disposal is recognised in \\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit and \\nLoss being the profit or loss on disposal of \\ninvestment in subsidiary.\\n (i)  Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has \\nbeen accounted under the Equity Method as per \\nInd AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint \\nVentures. Investments in joint operations are \\naccounted using the Proportionate Consolidation \\nMethod as per Ind AS 111 – Joint Arrangements.\\n (j)  The Group accounts for its share of post-\\nacquisition changes in net assets of associates \\nand joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised \\nprofits and losses resulting from transactions \\nbetween the Group and its associates and \\njoint ventures.\\n (k)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of profit / loss of \\nconsolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified \\nand adjusted against the income of the Group in \\norder to arrive at the net income attributable to \\nshareholders of the Company. (l)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of net assets \\nof consolidated subsidiaries is identified and \\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\nB.3  Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies\\n (a) Current and Non-Current Classification\\n   The Group presents assets and liabilities in the \\nBalance Sheet based on Current / Non-Current \\nclassification.\\n  An asset is treated as Current when it is –\\n  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be sold \\nor consumed in normal operating cycle;\\n  -  Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  Expected to be realised within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted \\nfrom being exchanged or used to settle a \\nliability for at least twelve months after the \\nreporting period.\\n  All other assets are classified as Non-Current.\\n  A liability is treated as Current when –\\n  -  It is expected to be settled in normal \\noperating cycle;\\n  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period.\\n   The Group classifies all other liabilities \\nas Non-Current.\\n   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified as \\nNon-Current Assets and Liabilities\\n (b) Business Combination\\n   Business Combinations are accounted for using \\nthe acquisition method of accounting, except \\nfor common control transactions which are \\naccounted using the pooling of interest method \\nthat is accounted at carrying values.\\n   The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair \\nvalue of the assets transferred, equity instruments \\nissued and liabilities assumed at their acquisition \\ndate i.e. the date on which control is acquired. \\nContingent consideration to be transferred \\nis recognised at fair value and included as \\npart of cost of acquisition. Transaction related \\ncosts are expensed in the period in which the \\ncosts are incurred.   For each business combination, the Group elects \\nwhether to measure the non-controlling interests \\nin the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate \\nshare of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\\n   Goodwill arising on business combination is \\ninitially measured at cost, being the excess of \\nthe aggregate of the consideration transferred \\nand the amount recognised for non-controlling \\ninterests, and any previous interest held, over \\nthe fair value of net identifiable assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually \\nand measured at cost less any accumulated \\nimpairment losses if any.\\n   Common control business combination: Business \\ncombinations involving entities or businesses that \\nare controlled by the group are accounted using \\nthe pooling of interest method.\\n (c) Property, Plant and Equipment\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost, \\nnet of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \\nrebates less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing cost and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets to its \\nworking condition for its intended use, net charges \\non foreign exchange contracts and adjustments \\narising from exchange rate variations attributable \\nto the assets. In case of land the Group has \\navailed fair value as deemed cost on the date of \\ntransition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with \\nthe item will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment \\nwhich are significant to the total cost of that item of \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and having different \\nuseful life are accounted separately. Other Indirect \\nExpenses incurred relating to project, net of income \\nearned during the project development stage \\nprior to its intended use, are considered as pre-\\noperative expenses and disclosed under Capital \\nWork-in-Progress.\\n   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment \\nis provided using written down value method on \\ndepreciable amount except in case of certain \\nassets of Oil to Chemicals segment which \\nare depreciated using straight line method. \\nDepreciation on wireless telecommunications \\nequipment and components is determined based \\non the expected pattern of consumption of the \\nexpected future economic benefits.

Gains or losses \\narising from derecognition of a Property, Plant \\nand Equipment are measured as the difference \\nbetween the net disposal proceeds and the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and are recognised \\nin the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \\nwhen the asset is derecognised.\\n (d) Leases\\n   The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of-\\nuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing \\narrangements, if the contract conveys the right to \\ncontrol the use of an identified asset.\\n   The contract conveys the right to control the use \\nof an identified asset, if it involves the use of an \\nidentified asset and the Group has substantially all \\nof the economic benefits from use of the asset and \\nhas right to direct the use of the identified asset. \\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise \\nof the amount of the initial measurement of the \\nlease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or before the commencement date plus \\nany initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use \\nassets is subsequently measured at cost less \\nany accumulated depreciation, accumulated \\nimpairment losses, if any and adjusted for any \\nremeasurement of the lease liability. The right-\\nof-use asset is depreciated using the straight-\\nline method from the commencement date \\nover the shorter of lease term or useful life of \\nright-of-use asset.\\n   The Group measures the lease liability at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at the commencement date of the lease. \\nThe lease payments are discounted using the \\ninterest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can \\nbe readily determined. If that rate cannot be \\nreadily determined, the Group uses incremental \\nborrowing rate.   For short-term and low value leases, the \\nGroup recognises the lease payments as an \\noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term.\\n   The Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as \\nan operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are \\nclassified as finance lease whenever the terms \\nof the lease transfer substantially all the risks and \\nrewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases \\nare classified as operating leases.\\n (e) Other Intangible Assets\\n   Other Intangible Assets are stated at cost of \\nacquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount \\nand rebates less accumulated amortisation / \\ndepletion and impairment loss, if any. Such cost \\nincludes purchase price, borrowing costs, and any \\ncost directly attributable for preparing the asset for \\nits intended use, net charges on foreign exchange \\ncontracts and adjustments arising from exchange \\nrate variations attributable to the Other Intangible \\nAssets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, \\nthe Group has availed fair value as deemed cost \\non the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with \\nthe item will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to \\nproject, net of income earned during the project \\ndevelopment stage prior to its intended use, \\nare considered as pre-operative expenses \\nand disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nunder Development.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of \\nan Other Intangible Asset are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n   The Group’s Other Intangible Assets include assets \\nwith finite and indefinite useful life. Assets with \\nfinite useful life are amortised on a straight-line \\nbasis over their expected useful life and assets \\nwith indefinite useful lives are not amortised but \\nare tested for impairment annually at the cash \\ngenerating unit level.\\n   A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies \\napplied to the Group’s Other Intangible Assets to \\nthe extent of depreciable amount is as follows.Particulars Depreciation\\nTechnical  \\nKnow-HowOver the useful life of the \\nunderlying assets ranging from 5 \\nyears to 35 years\\nComputer  \\nSoftwareOver a period of 5 to 10 years.\\nDevelopment  \\nRightsDepleted using the unit of production \\nmethod.

Development \\ncosts are capitalised as an intangible asset if it can \\nbe demonstrated that the project is expected to \\ngenerate future economic benefits, it is probable \\nthat those future economic benefits will flow to the \\nentity and the costs of the asset can be measured \\nreliably, else it is charged to the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n (g) Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n   Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash \\non hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and \\nshort-term highly liquid investments that are \\nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash \\nand which are subject to an insignificant risk of \\nchanges in value.\\n (h) Finance Costs\\n   Borrowing costs include exchange differences \\narising from foreign currency borrowings to the \\nextent they are regarded as an adjustment to \\nthe interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised as part of \\nthe cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of \\ntime to get ready for its intended use. Interest \\nincome earned on the temporary investment of \\nspecific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing \\ncosts eligible for capitalisation.\\n   All other borrowing costs are charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the \\nperiod for which they are incurred.\\n (i) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing \\nfor obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-\\nproducts which are valued at net realisable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of \\npurchase, cost of conversion and other costs \\nincluding manufacturing overheads net of \\nrecoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their \\nrespective present location and condition. Cost of \\nfinished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, \\nchemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, \\ntrading and other products are determined on \\nweighted average basis.\\n (j)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets \\n— Property, Plant and Equipment, \\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\n   The Group assesses at each reporting date \\nas to whether there is any indication that any \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other \\nIntangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash \\nGenerating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any \\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount \\nof an asset or CGU is estimated to determine \\nthe extent of impairment, if any. When it is not \\npossible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, the Group estimates \\nthe recoverable amount of the CGU to which \\nthe asset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to \\nthe extent, asset’s carrying amount exceeds its \\nrecoverable amount. The recoverable amount is \\nhigher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal \\nand value in use. Value in use is based on the \\nestimated future cash flows, discounted to their \\npresent value using pre-tax discount rate that \\nreflects current market assessments of the time \\nvalue of money and risk specific to the assets. The \\nimpairment loss recognised in prior accounting \\nperiod is reversed if there has been a change in \\nthe estimate of recoverable amount.\\n (k) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Group has \\na present obligation (legal or constructive) as a ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If the effect of the time value \\nof money is material, provisions are discounted \\nusing a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when \\nappropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When \\ndiscounting is used, the increase in the provision \\ndue to the passage of time is recognised as \\na finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Group records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfill decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding \\nof discount is recognised in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n (l) Contingent Liability\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \\nor more uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \\neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \\nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\\n (m) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term employee \\nbenefits expected to be paid in exchange for the \\nservices rendered by employees are recognised \\nas an expense during the period when the \\nemployees render the services.\\n  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Group recognises contribution payable to \\nthe provident fund scheme as an expense, when \\nan employee renders the related service. If the \\ncontribution payable to the scheme for service \\nreceived before the balance sheet date exceeds \\nthe contribution already paid, the deficit payable \\nto the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the \\ncontribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet \\ndate, then excess is recognised as an asset to \\nthe extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for \\nexample, a reduction in future payment or refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Group pays gratuity to the employees who \\nhave completed five years of service at the time \\nof resignation / superannuation. The gratuity is \\npaid @15 days basic salary for every completed \\nyear of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, \\n1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to \\nthe approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for \\ngratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity \\nfund has been approved by respective Income \\nTax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity \\nand other post-employment benefits is calculated \\nusing the Projected Unit Credit Method and \\nspread over the period during which the benefit is \\nexpected to be derived from employees’ services.\\n   Remeasurement gains and losses arising \\nfrom adjustments and changes in actuarial \\nassumptions are recognised in the period in which \\nthey occur, in Other Comprehensive Income.\\n  Employee Separation Costs\\n   The Group recognises the employee separation \\ncost when the scheme is announced and the \\nGroup is demonstrably committed to it.\\n (n) Tax Expenses\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprises of \\nCurrent Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is \\nrecognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, except to the extent that it relates to items \\nrecognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. \\nIn which case, the tax is also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income.\\n  i.  Current Tax\\n    Current tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from \\nor paid to the taxation authorities, based on \\ntax rates and laws that are enacted at the \\nBalance sheet date.\\n  ii. Deferred Tax\\n    Deferred Tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities in the financial \\nstatements and the corresponding tax bases \\nused in the computation of taxable profit. \\nDeferred Tax Assets are recognised to the \\nextent it is probable that taxable profit will \\nbe available against which the deductible \\ntemporary differences, and the carry forward \\nof unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred \\nTax Liabilities and Assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the \\nperiod in which the liability is settled or the \\nasset realised, based on tax rates (and tax \\nlaws) that have been enacted or substantively \\nenacted by the end of the reporting period. \\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities \\nand assets are reviewed at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n (o) Share Based Payments\\n   Equity-settled share based payments to \\nemployees and others providing similar services \\nare measured at the fair value of the equity \\ninstruments at the grant date. Details regarding \\nthe determination of the fair value of equity-\\nsettled share based payments transactions are \\nset out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined at \\nthe grant date of the equity-settled share based \\npayments is expensed on a straight line basis over \\nthe vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate \\nof equity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the \\nend of each reporting period, the Group revises \\nits estimate of the number of equity instruments \\nexpected to vest. The impact of the revision of \\nthe original estimates, if any, is recognised in \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss such \\nthat the cumulative expenses reflects the revised \\nestimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nShare Based Payments Reserve. The dilutive effect \\nof outstanding options is reflected as additional \\nshare dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\n (p)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded \\nat the exchange rate prevailing on the date \\nof transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated \\nat the functional currency’s closing rates of \\nexchange at the reporting date.\\n   Exchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except \\nto the extent of exchange differences which are \\nregarded as an adjustment to interest costs on \\nforeign currency borrowings that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of assets. \\nAdditionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign \\ncurrency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016, \\nwhich are related to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying \\ncost of such assets.\\n   Non-monetary items that are measured in terms \\nof historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded \\nusing the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair \\nvalue in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the date when the fair value was \\nmeasured. The gain or loss arising on translation \\nof non-monetary items measured at fair value \\nis treated in line with the recognition of the gain \\nor loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. \\ntranslation differences on items whose fair value \\ngain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive \\nIncome or Statement of Profit and Loss are also \\nrecognised in Other Comprehensive Income or \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where \\na non-monetary advance is paid / received, \\nthe date of transaction is the date on which the \\nadvance was initially recognised.

If a customer pays consideration \\nbefore the Group transfers goods or services to \\nthe customer, a contract liability is recognised \\nwhen the payment is made or the payment is \\ndue (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are \\nrecognised as revenue when the Group performs \\nunder the contract.\\n  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a financial asset is \\nrecognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s \\nright to receive the amount has been established.\\n (r) Financial Instruments\\n  i. Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nfinancial assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair \\nvalue on initial recognition. Purchase and sale \\nof financial assets are recognised using trade \\ndate accounting.  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n  a)  Financial assets measured at \\nAmortised Cost (AC)\\n    A financial asset is measured at Amortised \\nCost if it is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is to hold the asset in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the contractual \\nterms of the financial asset give rise to cash \\nflows on specified dates that represent solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n  b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair \\nValue Through Other Comprehensive \\nIncome (FVTOCI)\\n    A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is \\nheld within a business model whose objective \\nis achieved by both collecting contractual \\ncash flows and selling financial assets and \\nthe contractual terms of the financial asset \\ngive rise on specified dates to cash flows that \\nrepresent solely payments of principal and \\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n  c)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\\n    A financial asset which is not classified \\nin any of the above categories are \\nmeasured at FVTPL.\\n    Financial assets are reclassified subsequent \\nto their recognition, if the Group changes its \\nbusiness model for managing those financial \\nassets. Changes in business model are \\nmade and applied prospectively from the \\nreclassification date which is the first day of \\nimmediately next reporting period following \\nthe changes in business model in accordance \\nwith principles laid down under Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments.\\n  C. Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, \\nexcept for those equity investments for which \\nthe Group has elected to present the value \\nchanges in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’.\\n    However, dividend on such equity investments \\nis recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss \\nwhen the Company’s right to receive payment \\nis established.\\n  D.  Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group \\nuses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial assets \\nother than those measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected \\nCredit Losses are measured through a loss \\nallowance at an amount equal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For trade receivables, the Group applies \\n‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \\nThe Group uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Group uses 12 month \\nExpected Credit Loss to provide for \\nimpairment loss where there is no significant \\nincrease in credit risk. If there is significant \\nincrease in credit risk full lifetime Expected \\nCredit Loss is used.\\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial liabilities are recognised at fair \\nvalue and in case of borrowings, net of directly \\nattributable cost. Fees of recurring nature \\nare directly recognised in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within one \\nyear from the balance sheet date, the carrying \\namounts approximate fair value due to the \\nshort maturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Group uses various derivative financial \\ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \\ncurrency swaps, forwards and options and \\ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk of \\nchanges in interest rates, exchange rates and \\ncommodity prices. At the inception of a hedge \\nrelationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to \\nwhich the Group wishes to apply hedge \\naccounting and the risk management \\nobjective and strategy for undertaking the \\nhedge. Such derivative financial instruments \\nare initially recognised at fair value on the \\ndate on which a derivative contract is entered \\ninto and are also subsequently measured \\nat fair value. Derivatives are carried as \\nfinancial assets when the fair value is positive \\nand as financial liabilities when the fair \\nvalue is negative.\\n    Any gains or losses arising from changes \\nin the fair value of derivatives are taken \\ndirectly to Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, except for the effective portion \\nof cash flow hedge which is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income and later to \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, \\nwhen the hedged item affects profit or loss \\nor is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in \\nthe recognition of a non-financial asset or \\nnon-financial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n    The Group designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative financial assets / liabilities \\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the risk \\nof movement in interest rates and foreign \\nexchange rates for foreign exchange \\nexposure on highly probable future cash \\nflows attributable to a recognised asset or \\nliability or forecast cash transactions. When \\na derivative is designated as a cash flow \\nhedging instrument, the effective portion of \\nchanges in the fair value of the derivative is of \\nProfit and Loss as finance cost. recognised in \\nthe cash flow hedging reserve being part of \\nOther Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective \\nportion of changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative is recognised immediately in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If \\nthe hedging relationship no longer meets the \\ncriteria for hedge accounting, then hedge \\naccounting is discontinued prospectively. If \\nthe hedging instrument expires or is sold / \\nterminated or exercised, the cumulative gain \\nor loss on the hedging instrument recognised \\nin cash flow hedging reserve till the period \\nthe hedge was effective remains in cash \\nflow hedging reserve until the underlying \\ntransaction occurs. The cumulative gain \\nor loss previously recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve is transferred to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If the forecasted transaction is no \\nlonger expected to occur, then the amount \\naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is \\nreclassified in the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\n  B. Fair Value Hedge\\n    The Group designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative financial assets / liabilities \\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the risk \\nof change in fair value of hedged item due to \\nmovement in interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates and commodity prices.\\n    Changes in the fair value of hedging \\ninstruments and hedged items that are \\ndesignated and qualify as fair value hedges \\nare recorded in the Consolidated Statement \\nof Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship \\nno longer meets the criteria for hedge \\naccounting, the adjustment to the carrying \\namount of a hedged item for which the \\neffective interest method is used is amortised \\nto Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \\nover the period of maturity.\\n iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n   The Group derecognises a financial asset when \\nthe contractual rights to the cash flows from the \\nfinancial asset expire or it transfers the financial \\nasset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition \\nunder Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments. A \\nfinancial liability (or a part of a financial liability) \\nis derecognised from the Group’s Balance Sheet \\nwhen the obligation specified in the contract is \\ndischarged or cancelled or expires.\\n v. Offsetting\\n   Financial assets and financial liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in the \\nBalance Sheet when, and only when, the Group \\nhas a legally enforceable right to set off the \\namount and it intends, either to settle them on \\na net basis or to realise the asset and settle the \\nliability\\xa0simultaneously.\\n (s) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-Current Assets are classified as Held for Sale if \\ntheir carrying amount will be recovered principally \\nthrough a sale transaction rather than through \\ncontinuing use and sale is considered highly \\nprobable. A sale is considered as highly probable \\nwhen decision has been made to sell, assets \\nare available for immediate sale in its present \\ncondition, assets are being actively marketed \\nand sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of \\nclassification. Non-current assets held for sale are \\nneither depreciated nor amortised. Assets and \\nliabilities classified as Held for Sale are measured \\nat the lower of their carrying amount and fair value \\nless cost of disposal and are presented separately \\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Group has adopted Successful Efforts Method \\n(SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. \\nThe policy of recognition of exploration and \\nevaluation expenditure is considered in line with \\nthe principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological \\nand geophysical studies, petroleum exploration \\nlicense fees and general and administration costs \\ndirectly attributable to exploration and evaluation \\nactivities are expensed off. The costs incurred on \\nacquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on \\nexploration and evaluation other than those which \\nare expensed off are accounted for as Intangible \\nAssets under Development. All development \\ncosts incurred in respect of Proved Reserves are \\nalso capitalised under Intangible Assets under \\nDevelopment. Once a well is ready to commence \\ncommercial production, the costs accumulated \\nin Intangible Assets under Development are \\nclassified as Other Intangible Assets corresponding \\nto proved developed oil and gas reserves. The \\nexploration and evaluation expenditure which \\ndoes not result in discovery of proved oil and gas \\nreserves and all cost pertaining to production \\nare charged to the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\n   The Group uses technical estimation of reserves as \\nper the Petroleum Resources Management System \\nguidelines 2011 and standard geological and \\nreservoir engineering methods. The reserve review \\nand evaluation is carried out annually. Oil and Gas \\nJoint Ventures are in the nature of Joint Operations. \\nAccordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income \\nand expenditure are accounted on the basis of \\navailable information on a line-by-line basis with \\nsimilar items in the financial statements, according \\nto the participating interest of the Group.\\n (u) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures used \\nin determination of basic earnings per share to \\ntake into account the conversion of all dilutive \\npotential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity \\nshares are deemed converted as at the beginning \\nof the period unless issued at a later date.C.  Critical Accounting Judgements \\nand Key Sources of Estimation \\nUncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Group’s financial statements \\nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the \\naccompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these \\nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes \\nthat require a material adjustment to the carrying \\namount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\\n(a) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Group’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Group’s estimates of its oil \\nand natural gas reserves. The Group bases it’s proved \\nreserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable \\ncertainty with rigorous technical and commercial \\nassessments based on conventional industry practice \\nand regulatory requirements.\\n  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to \\ncalculate depletion charges for the Group’s oil and gas \\nproperties. The impact of changes in estimated proved \\nreserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising \\nthe remaining carrying value of the asset over the \\nexpected future production. Oil and natural gas \\nreserves also have a direct impact on the assessment \\nof the recoverability of asset carrying values reported \\nin the financial statements. Details on proved reserves \\nand production both on product and geographical \\nbasis are provided in Note 34.\\n(b) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs are recognised \\nwhen the Group has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.\\n(c)  Property Plant and Equipment / Other \\nIntangible Assets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating \\nin the manner intended by the management. Property, Plant and Equipment / Other Intangible Assets are \\ndepreciated / amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife, after taking into account estimated residual value. \\nSpectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity \\nperiod, based on the expected pattern of consumption \\nof the expected future economic benefits.\\n  Management reviews the estimated useful life and \\nresidual values of the assets annually in order to \\ndetermine the amount of depreciation / amortisation \\nto be recorded during any reporting period. The useful \\nlife and residual values are based on the Group’s \\nhistorical experience with similar assets and take into \\naccount anticipated technological and future risks. \\nThe depreciation / amortisation for future periods \\nis revised if there are significant changes from \\nprevious estimates.\\n(d)  Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgements are required in assessing the \\nrecoverability of overdue trade receivables and \\ndetermining whether a provision against those \\nreceivables is required. Factors considered include \\nthe credit rating of the counterparty, the amount \\nand timing of anticipated future payments and any \\npossible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk \\nof non-payment.\\n(e) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of the \\nliability requires the application of judgement to \\nexisting facts and circumstances, which can be subject \\nto change. The carrying amounts of provisions and \\nliabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take \\naccount of changing facts and circumstances.\\n(f)  Impairment of Financial and Non-\\nFinancial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are \\nbased on assumptions about risk of default and \\nexpected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement \\nin making these assumptions and selecting the inputs \\nto the impairment calculation, based on Group’s past \\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-\\nlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets the Group estimates \\nasset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an \\nasset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less \\ncosts of disposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs \\nof disposal, recent market transactions are taken into \\naccount, if no such transactions can be identified, an \\nappropriate valuation model is used.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of \\nthe PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. \\nThe Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million \\n(` 1,248 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand $ 247 million- ` 1,872 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum \\nhas been considered as contingent liability.\\n    In supersession of Ministry’s Gazette Notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified the \\nNew Domestic natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit \\ndifferential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted \\nto NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account \\nmaintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ` 295 crore (net) as at \\n31st March, 2022 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets. Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\\n   Tribunal has scheduled further procedural hearing in the matter.\\n34.4 (a)   GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US $1.55 \\nbillion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents \\nof the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated \\n24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final \\nAward of the Arbitral Tribunal on 15th November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. The Appeal is currently being \\nheard before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.\\n  (b)    Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and RIL (together the Claimants) against GOI \\non 16th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain \\nPSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), \\nand separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the \\n2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged \\nissues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large \\npart vide its final partial award dated 1st October, 2018 (‘2018 FPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English \\nCommercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and \\nupheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration \\nTribunal for determination. On 29th January, 2021 the Tribunal issued a further final partial award on the remitted matter \\nand GOI has challenged the same before the English Commercial Court. Claimants have filed an application before \\nthe Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet \\nto schedule the final re-computation of accounts phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of \\nClaimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\\n     GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration \\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the \\n2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards.  The Claimants contend \\nthat GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI’s Execution Petition is currently sub judice before Delhi High Court.\\n   (c)   NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by RIL before the Hon’ble Bombay \\nHigh Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for \\nsupply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and RIL is of \\nthe view that NTPC’s claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and RIL.\\n         Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/\\nlitigations.

Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and \\nreceivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to \\ncustomers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \\nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\\n The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \\nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \\nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv)  Liquidity Risk\\n Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \\nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient \\nfunding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash \\nflow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\\n The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. \\nTreasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net \\ndeficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank \\ndeposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to \\navoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(` in crore)\\nMaturity Profile As at 31st March, 2022 *\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months6-12 \\nMonths1-3 Years 3-5 YearsAbove 5 \\nYearsTotal\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@ 2,266  6,715  18,207  81,494  44,682  62,456  2,15,820 \\nCurrent ^ 39,736  11,228  1,214  -    -    -    52,178 \\nTotal  42,002  17,943  19,421  81,494  44,682  62,456  2,67,998 \\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 965 954 1,880 6,765 5,475 6,315  22,354 \\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards  4,740  1,805  1,001  683  -    -    8,229 \\nOptions  151  2  20  -    -    -    173 \\nInterest Rate Swaps  -    -    4  598  70  -    672 \\nTotal  4,891  1,807  1,025  1,281  70  -    9,074 \\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to ` 1,59,330 crore.\\n# Includes ` 1,053 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and ` 48 crore as revaluation gain.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n^ Includes ` 592 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n(` in crore)\\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2021 *\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths 3-6 Months 6-12 \\nMonths 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 \\nYears Total \\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@3,083 4,629 20,489 66,891 62,782 34,668  1,92,542 \\nCurrent ^53,402 2,938 4,031  -    -    -    60,371 \\nTotal 56,485 7,567 24,520 66,891 62,782 34,668 2,52,913\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 487 485 963 3,483 2,631 4,996  13,045 \\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards  1,518  841  176  2,012  -    -    4,547 \\nOptions  178  -    33  -    -    -   211\\nInterest Rate Swaps  10  1  241  575  76  -   903\\nTotal  1,706  842  450  2,587  76  -   5,661\\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to ` 1,08,897 crore.\\n# Includes ` 812 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon.\\n^ Includes ` 290 crore as Commercial Paper Discount. C. Hedge Accounting\\n   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and \\nother feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group \\nhas adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved \\nhedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange \\ntraded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve \\nthis objective.\\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a \\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships.
